      <title>Chapter 1 - Elucidating models of ambidexterity and their boundaries for innovation management</title>
      <link>https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part1/chapter1/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part1/chapter1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this first chapter of literature review, we propose to start
discussing the seminal paper by James Gardner March published in
&lt;em&gt;Organization Science&lt;/em&gt; in 1991 entitled: &amp;ldquo;Exploration and exploitation
in organizational learning&amp;rdquo; (James G March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;). We,
of course, put this article into perspective with the flourishing
streams of literature which have rooted their assumptions in the
problem-based and decision-making background mobilized by J.March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the manuscript highlighted that the streams of
literature of organizational ambidexterity could be revisited by
developments in innovation management, such as exploration project
management. This preliminary assumption is induced by the limitations
raised by several authors in the field of ambidexterity, specially on
the how to achieve such model (Birkinshaw and Gupta

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Birkinshaw2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;; O’Reilly and Tushman

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-OReilly2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;; Benner and Tushman 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Benner2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;).
And it is also backed up by the organization studies dimension
challenging project management (Sydow, Lindkvist, and Defillippi

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Sydow2004&#34;&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;; Bakker et al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Bakker2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;;
Söderlund, Hobbs, and Ahola 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Soderlund2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;; Söderlund and Müller 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Soderlund2014a&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;) and more specifically exploration project management, tightly linked to innovation management literature
(Lenfle and Loch 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lenfle2010&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lenfle2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;; Davies, Manning, and Söderlund 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Davies2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The several challenges, in the literature briefly discussed so far,
point at the tensions and fuzziness at the crossroads of innovation
management and organizational studies. More precisely, the original
assumptions of &lt;em&gt;exploration vs. exploitation&lt;/em&gt; for organization learning
and adaptation may be now in conflict with the engines of innovation:
managing the unknown through project management. The unknown has gained
ground over time up to the point where models of ambidexterity may no
longer be valid. It is this interaction between ambidexterity and the
unknown that will guide our literature review. We are keen on
understanding what happens at the potential edges of ambidexterity’s
validity domain. We propose then to start anew with the foundational
paper (James G March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;) on which literature piled
up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The notion of exploration and exploitation were typified in the
well-defined situation of problem-solving and associated decisions to
balance off these two constructs for organizational learning and firm
competition for survival and primacy. The first section &lt;a href=&#34;#balancing-exploration-vs-exploitation-an-incomplete-model&#34; title=&#34;Balancing exploration vs. exploitation: an incomplete model?&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; elaborates on the model and its boundaries as defined by J.March. These boundaries have separated it from the unknown, whereas it has been
feeding streams of literature in innovation management, organizational
structure and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second section  &lt;a href=&#34;#organizational-ambidexterity-organizing-unbounded-problem-solving&#34; title=&#34;Organizational ambidexterity: organizing unbunded problem-solving&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; discusses the latter with the emergence of the &lt;em&gt;organizational ambidexterity&lt;/em&gt; construct and prescription of organizational designs
supporting innovation. Limitations identified by major researchers in
the field are reported opening the debate on the micro-foundations of
ambidexterity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the third section &lt;a href=&#34;#deciding-to-innovate-micro-foundations-of-ambidextrous-organizations&#34; title=&#34;Deciding to innovate: micro-foundations of ambidextrous organizations?&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; looks at generative processes and their contributions to exploration and exploitation. It allows us to extend the behavioural roots of
problem-solving and decision-making with design reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;balancing-exploration-vs-exploitation-an-incomplete-model&#34;&gt;Balancing exploration vs. exploitation: an incomplete model?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In (James G March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;), James March presents a model supporting a Schumpeterian view of a firm’s sustainability with an organizational learning perspective: exploiting old certainties or exploring new possibilities. The firm is described as a system, where choices are made within the organization to engage in exploration or exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[..] maintaining an appropriate balance between exploration and
exploitation is a primary factor in system survival and prosperity.&lt;/em&gt;
(James G March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;, 71)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade-off discussion is developed with a reference point taken in
rational models of choice. A decision problem is then composed of: a set
of states of nature $S$ from which consequences are envisioned $X$ with
associated probabilities $\mu$, a cost function $c:x\in X \rightarrow y\in\mathbb{R}^+$ and the decision-maker is requested to build up decision function $d:s\in S \rightarrow x\in X$.
Several axioms are necessary to support the theory depending on the model used, and the simplest version can be found in (Wald 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Wald1945a&#34;&gt;1945&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Wald1949&#34;&gt;1949&lt;/a&gt;), corresponding to basis on which (Savage 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Savage1954&#34;&gt;1954&lt;/a&gt;) and (Raiffa 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Raiffa1968&#34;&gt;1968&lt;/a&gt;) have developed in management education (Giocoli 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Giocoli2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;; Fourcade and Khurana

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Fourcade2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;).
But before considering the decisional dimension, it is worth noting the
conception of action: problems &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; to the agent, who then
calculates accordingly given previous statistical learning from the past
and additional information available on the spot. The calculation is
seen as suboptimal given the limited/bounded rationality of the agent
and the collective in an organizational context (Simon

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Simon1955&#34;&gt;1955&lt;/a&gt;). The organizational behaviour is then focalized
on the agent, its beliefs and interactions with others and available
information. It allows then envisioning the contribution to the
performance and survival of the firm as beliefs evolve and the
environment changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These features have been stressed in a recent review literature
published in &lt;em&gt;Strategic Organization&lt;/em&gt; (Wilden et al.

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Wilden2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;) among other evolutions of the constructs of
&lt;em&gt;exploration&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;exploitation&lt;/em&gt; following March’s seminal article. With
an exhaustive dataset and data-mining methods, they have observed the
evolution of the range of keywords initially proposed by March for
exploration and exploitation (see
Fig.&lt;a href=&#34;#fig:explorationkeywords&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;fig:explorationkeywords&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href=&#34;#fig:exploitationkeywords&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;fig:exploitationkeywords&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exploration includes things captured by terms such as search,
variation, risk taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery,
innovation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exploitation includes such things as refinement, choice, production,
efficiency, selection, implementation, execution.&lt;/em&gt; (James G March

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;, 71)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review points out the notion exploration has gained more attention:
please note the difference in scale (y-axis), it is astonishing! It
reinforces the importance of exploration to balance out biases of
exploitation, but we should also keep in mind that exploitation should
also be maintained to a certain extent (Birkinshaw and Gupta

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Birkinshaw2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;). Co-existence is key to the performance and
survival of the firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In (Wilden et al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Wilden2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;), they show the trade-off
dilemma has drifted across several clusters of management literature
with a recent emphasis on ambidexterity, organizational structure and
performance (see section 
&lt;a href=&#34;#balancing-exploration-vs-exploitation-an-incomplete-model&#34; title=&#34;Balancing exploration vs. exploitation: an incomplete model?&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;)
and innovation management (see section 
&lt;a href=&#34;#deciding-to-innovate-micro-foundations-of-ambidextrous-organizations&#34; title=&#34;Deciding to innovate: micro-foundations of ambidextrous organizations?&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;)
Several calls for future research are made to contribute to reconsider
the organizational behaviour roots, extensiveness and micro-foundations
of the constructs of exploration/exploitation, and their articulation
with organizational boundaries (e.g. intra-organizational or across
organizations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    These issues are discussed in the following sections. But before
starting to discuss the topics raised in the literature, we propose in
the following paragraphs to question the underlying hypotheses made on
exploration and exploitation. We focus then on the separation enforced
between the two and how it contributes to organizational learning,
behaviours at work and the issue of sustaining the balance for
performance and survival.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;adaptive-processes-supporting-organizational-learning&#34;&gt;Adaptive processes supporting organizational learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adaptive processes that are framed by &lt;em&gt;given&lt;/em&gt; problems will call for
numerous mechanisms ranging from &amp;ldquo;rational models of choice&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;theories
of limited rationality&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;organizational learning and evolutionary
models of organizational forms and technologies&amp;rdquo; (James G March

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;, 72). Within the information-processing paradigm,
the notion of &amp;ldquo;search&amp;rdquo; is mobilized to understand to which extent
decisions should be made to consider &lt;em&gt;given&lt;/em&gt; alternatives and available
information to organization action. As it is stressed, the decision
model is quickly jeopardized with the observational capacity of the
agent not being able to acknowledge new alternatives, sure thing
principle&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, or uncontrolled externalities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The problem is complicated by the possibilities that new investment
alternatives may appear, that probability distributions may not be
stable, or that they may depend on the choices made by others&lt;/em&gt; (James
G March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;, 72).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unobservability reinforces the limitation to adaptive process which
should be optimized because of bounded rationality and theories of
satisfying (Simon 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Simon1955&#34;&gt;1955&lt;/a&gt;) in addition to anchoring
effects and other cognitive biases revealed by the works of Amos Tversky
and Daniel Kahneman in their prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Kahneman1979a&#34;&gt;1979&lt;/a&gt;; Tversky and Kahneman

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Tversky1974&#34;&gt;1974&lt;/a&gt;). In the field of theories addressing the
unknown, to go beyond available information and knowledge, theories of
creativity with the support of cognitive psychology have emphasized
similar phenomena: fixation effects (Smith, Ward, and Schumacher

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Smith1993&#34;&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt;; Ward 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ward2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;). But the bridge
remains to be built between these two separate fields of research where
theories and experimentations means do not yet synergize.
The targets associated with the problem (pre-)framing define a reference
frame to value learning and knowledge management. Organizational
learning has stressed the importance of &lt;em&gt;refining&lt;/em&gt; alternatives and
&lt;em&gt;inventing&lt;/em&gt; new ones. Exploration precedes or augments exploitation and
will have antagonistic effects on the performance of decision-making
(e.g. skills improvement to execute existing alternatives)(Levinthal and
March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Levinthal1981&#34;&gt;1981&lt;/a&gt;). This viewpoint on learning
performance preconceives its criteria and the organizational ties
between the exploration and exploitation regimes. It tends to hide the
complexities associated with multi-scale phenomena at the individual,
social and organizational levels as specified by J.March himself on
balancing out the two regimes. Organizing an appropriate decision
balancing exploration and exploitation becomes critical.
In the tradition of adaptive process, the proposal from evolutionary
theories introducing the notions of &lt;em&gt;variation&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;selection&lt;/em&gt; is then
quite seducing. J.March describes the purpose of these regimes and
limitations by proposing the garbage-can decision process as a reservoir
to protect from externalities and the unknown(Eisenhardt and Zbaracki

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Eisenhardt1992&#34;&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Effective selection among forms, routines, or practices is essential
to survival, but so also is the generation of new alternative
practices, particularly in a changing environment.&lt;/em&gt; (James G March

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;, 72)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adaptation speed and the prior exploration/exploitation of
appropriate practices will make a difference in the environment. Again,
a structural or a sequential view of managing exploration and
exploitation is suggested to take place at different levels: individual,
organizational and social. For the organizational learning perspective,
the interactions between individuals and the organization, and the
competition for primacy between organizational (sub-)groups will
contribute to the exploration/exploitation trade-off and vice-versa. The
presented model is robust enough to cover several streams of literature
and include some of the multi-scale complexity.
Now, on the value of both regimes, J.March gives further indications on
the necessity to separate them. Exploration is presented as a sacrifice
and vulnerable because of overarching performance criteria derived from
exploitation. The exploration valuation framework is
exploitation-driven, as if on the same continuum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compared to returns from exploitation, return from exploration are
systematically less certain, more remote in time, and organizational
more distance from the locus of action and adaption.&lt;/em&gt; (James G March

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;, 73)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reinforces the antagonistic effects of deciding of the
allocation/division of resources to one of the regimes. The exploitation
reference point also complexifies the understanding and efficiency of
exploration during its refinement towards exploitation. Exploration is
pictured as rather complex and fuzzy, highly uncertain and should be
transformed into more systematic regime, like exploitation to perform
better:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reason inhibits foolishness; learning and imitation inhibit
experimentation. This is not an accident but is a consequence of the
temporal and spatial proximity of the effects of exploitation, as well
as their precision and interconnectedness.&lt;/em&gt; (James G March

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;, 73)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These views tend to emphasize paradoxically the orthogonality of
exploration activities with respect to exploitation still triggering
antagonistic effects for a given performance valuation reference. At the
light of this model we could synthesize in the figure below:&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-schematics-of-exploration-and-exploitation-trade-off&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite hiding several details of the model, the figure highlights the
adaptation perspective and the learning required channelling the
organization at the light of changes in the environment. It is a
temporal representation, but it could also be picture in parallel,
showing exploration oriented in certain directions usually blinded by
exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We ask several questions echoing the limitations mentioned by J.March
and the exhaustive literature review (Wilden et al.
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Wilden2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;) relative to the learning mechanisms and
experimentation (discovery). The search-based model should enable
reaching full rationality in opposition to its boundedness. As suggested
in (James G March &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;), foolishness could be driving
force. We must then clarify the behaviours, their categories with
respect to problem-solving, search and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it required to sustain the separation and balance between
exploration/exploitation? How predictable are the discovery patterns?
What are the spatial and temporal parameters to play with to balance out
ambidexterity?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning-with-respect-to-foolishness-novelty-and-creative-logics&#34;&gt;Learning with respect to foolishness, novelty and creative logics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to study learning mechanisms, James March along with other
great researchers have extensively studied the sociology of
organizations and some, if not most, have taken a close look at
engineering activities (Dong, March, and Workiewicz

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Dong2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, 8). Engineering departments among other functions
in the firm have created over decades design and engineering rules, set
of established practices required to support product development and
manufacturing. Engineering has been one of the major epicentre of
novelty and also the baseline for daily exploitation. It is a place of
tension and balance for exploration and exploitation regimes. Learning,
imitation and forms of rationalization are deployed in such context to
sustain exploitation regime. The knowledge management gravitates around
and deals with the established rational model organizing collective
action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an evolutionary perspective, efficiency can be improved with a better
selection with respect to the production of such engineering
organizations. Imitation is one sub-activity with the risk of converging
on sub-optimal selections. Ways of controlling this convergence must be
envisioned such as bringing novel knowledge, or in a network theory
perspective, slightly disconnecting agents (Dong, March, and Workiewicz

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Dong2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, 8). Encouraging novelty becomes critical and
J.March recalls that most novelties fail, leading to the promotion of
the garbage-can decision model appropriate for unstable environment
paired with a selection process. Benefits of others experimentation can
also be drawn fostering vicarious learning (Riedl and Seidel

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Riedl2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re going to engineer an evolutionary process, you have to work
on improving selection, and you have to work on improving novelty.&lt;/em&gt;
(Dong, March, and Workiewicz 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Dong2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, 9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novelty is odd and uncertain, and this failure rate calls for some
&lt;em&gt;technologies of foolishness&lt;/em&gt; by opposition to exploitation behaviours
ruled by established technologies of model-based rationality (March

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;; Dong, March, and Workiewicz

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Dong2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;). Rational models have misspecified the
organization of action due to numerous difficulties: uncertainty and the
unexpected (Shackle 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Shackle1949&#34;&gt;1949&lt;/a&gt;), causal complexity,
preference ambiguity (Slovic 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Slovic1995&#34;&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;; Camerer,
Loewenstein, and Rabin 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Camerer2004&#34;&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;) and strategic
interaction (Pettigrew 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Pettigrew1977&#34;&gt;1977&lt;/a&gt;; Eisenhardt and
Zbaracki 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Eisenhardt1992&#34;&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;; Chia 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Chia1994&#34;&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;) just
to name a few. So, other models with feedback means have developed to
adapt continuously, to counteract myopic behaviours (Levinthal and March

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Levinthal1993&#34;&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt;) and surprise effects associated to
incompleteness of previously mentioned models of rationality. Yet, these
models may not reach a global optimum (Brehmer 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Brehmer1980&#34;&gt;1980&lt;/a&gt;;
Carroll and Harrison 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Carroll1994&#34;&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;; Barron and Erev

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Barron2003&#34;&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These problem-based modelling approaches will frame the behaviour of the
algorithm with certain boundaries and will not facilitate discovery of
other domains. We can all picture a robot hitting a wall in a infinite
loop with the hope to minimize the distance to the objective behind the
wall despite having numerous sensors. Limitations of the agent bound its
rationality because of numerous biases, but also the environment minors
the performance of adaptive processes for being too complex, endogenous,
subjective and contested (March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, 205).
Experimentation is then required to put the robot in a position where
novelty can be observed and gradually understood given pre-conceived
rules. In that perspective, the novelty-search algorithms (Nguyen,
Yosinski, and Clune 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Nguyen2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;) applied for robots to adapt
like animals in a resilience mode (Cully et al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Cully2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;).
This sets the frontier of problem-solving perspective and possible
decisions, but leaves potential ones undiscovered due to bounded
rationality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complexity rises when considering unusual experiences compared to
existing knowledge basis and rational model as discussed in by Raghu
Garud with a narrative perspective (Garud, Dunbar, and Bartel

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Garud2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;). In the following extract, J.March plays with
the edges of the model and the necessity to &lt;em&gt;generate variety&lt;/em&gt;, but we
can expect this generativity is limited to the landscape of bounded
rationality and search:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first central requirement of adaptation is a reproductive process
that replicates successes. The attributes associated with survival
need to be reproduced more reliably than the attributes that are not.
The second central requirement of an adaptive process is that it
generate variety.&lt;/em&gt; (March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, 205)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, creative logics or generative processes in a broader and weaker
sense (Epstein 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Epstein1990&#34;&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Epstein1999&#34;&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;) are
required to bring variety to the process and add up to the existing
knowledge (bounded and unbounded). But again, it goes beyond
search/discovery and is rather associated with novelty and the reaching
for the unknown.
Exploration regime in its quest for variation, requires alternative
mechanisms such as organizational slack, randomness, &lt;em&gt;errors&lt;/em&gt; of
adaptive process parameters and other mechanisms shifting the
performance frontier with objectives derived from intuition of a leader.
J.March makes then a case for foolishness and some &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of
irrationality compared to the normative technologies of rationality
established in the organization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The designers of adaptive systems often proclaim a need for
deliberately introducing more of them to supplement exploration. In
their organizational manifestations, they advocate such things as
foolishness, brainstorming, identity-based avoidance of the structures
of consequences, devil’s advocacy, conflict, and weak memories
(George, 1980; George and Stern, 2002; Sutton, 2002). They see
potential advantages in organizational partitioning or cultural
isolation, the creation of ideological, informational, intellectual,
and emotional islands that inhibit convergence to a single world view
(March, 2004). Whereas the mechanisms of exploitation involve
connecting organizational behaviour to revealed reality and shared
understandings, the recommended mechanisms of exploration involve
deliberately weakening those connections.&lt;/em&gt; (March

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, 207)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numerous failures of rational models and their technologies are
&lt;em&gt;utopian&lt;/em&gt; (March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, 209):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is argued that the link between rationality and conventional
knowledge keeps rational technologies reliable but inhibits creative
imagination. This characterization seems plausible, but it probably
underestimates the potential contribution of rational technologies to
foolishness and radical visions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It encourages then the &amp;ldquo;heroism of foolishness&amp;rdquo; to support exploration
and the use of technologies of rationality as a baseline to enhance
exploration, and avoids pure irrationality. This last sentence blurs the
boundaries of exploration and exploitation, let it be on the same
continuum or in two orthogonal planes. It is a thin-wall domain defined
here pushing the debate down the line of functional stupidity in
organization (Alvesson and Spicer 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Alvesson2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;), pure
irrationality in (Brunsson 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Brunsson1982&#34;&gt;1982&lt;/a&gt;) and his subsequent
works, or the role of opportunism and reliability (Lumineau and Verbeke

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lumineau2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;; Foss and Weber 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Foss2016a&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exploratory foolishness may sometimes be desirable, and technologies
of rationality may be important sources of exploration; but the use of
rational technologies in complex situations is unlikely to be
sustained by the main events and processes of history.&lt;/em&gt; (March

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, 211)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TeThe main question we can ask ourselves so far is &lt;strong&gt;how collective action
should be organized in such domain of foolishness tangent to
irrationality&lt;/strong&gt;. And not managing appears almost clearly out of question
due to the necessity to balancing the exploration regime to reach a
global optimum with an enhanced adaptive process. We have reasons to
worry as several authors have described the variety of learning
behaviours (Garcias, Dalmasso, and Sardas &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Garcias2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;) at
the light of learning/performing paradox (Smith and Lewis
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Smith2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;); or even the systematic violation of management
rules contributing to learning (Mangematin et al.
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Mangematin2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we articulate it with learning mechanisms and overall knowledge
management? How could we turn such &lt;em&gt;deviant&lt;/em&gt; behaviour into resources or
at least start building dynamic capacities that will support innovation?
Foolishness could contribute to unbounding individual and collective
rationality, but perhaps also extend into the unknown. It remains
unclear in the model and proposals made by J.March.xt&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;shifting-the-performance-frontier-with-innovation&#34;&gt;Shifting the performance frontier with innovation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seminal paper of 1991 review (Wilden et al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Wilden2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;)
addresses two research gaps related to the re-connection with
behavioural roots and supporting capabilities required for
exploration/exploitation (Wilden et al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Wilden2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, 11):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do behavioural tendencies of managers, such as the risk
propensity of executives, relate to a firm’s ability to explore versus
exploit? How do individual tendencies to explore versus exploit
interact with environmental trends at the institution, industry, and
country levels?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do capabilities that support exploration and exploitation emerge
and become embedded in organizational routines? Are there differences
in the dynamic capabilities required for executing exploration versus
exploitation? Which dynamic capabilities are required to overcome path
dependencies in exploitation?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have stressed in the previous paragraphs, enhancing adaptive
processes with novelty-driven processes supporting exploration may lead
to numerous difficulties when trying to reconnect with exploitation
regime: routines, rules and practices. The nature of exploration could
otherwise fall in the domain of behaviours based on foolishness or
rationality.
In a behavioural perspective, it is crucial to understand what
facilitates the allocation of resources for such activities. The
underlying decision-making process must be clarified. Decisions are seen
as trackers and reflections of the organizational life, and some of
these are consigned into technologies of rationality. Agents in the firm
develop associated routines that are rationally bounded and they
consequently struggle to reach global optima on an objective Pareto
front as pictured in the
Fig.&lt;a href=&#34;#fig:explorationregimes&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;fig:explorationregimes&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;.
The previous subsection highlighted that agents are bounded in a biased
knowledgeable space; exploration allows them to reach statistical optima
on the Pareto front. Foolishness could perhaps contribute to the search
vector for exploration, and it remains unclear if it contributes to
generative processes broadly, into the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

    Schematics of behaviours
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tension created by exploration behaviours interfere with existing
routines and rational models that could be expressed in terms of
performance criteria delimiting the Pareto front: foolishness creates an
exploitation oddity, an unusual experience (Garud, Dunbar, and Bartel

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Garud2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;) that encourages to revisit the Pareto front
definition or even the performance framing (x and y axes).
Giovanni Gavetti (Gavetti 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Gavetti2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;) pinpoints the
ability to overcome focal behavioural bounds and reach for cognitively
distant opportunities. Instead of paying attention to local collective
action, he focuses on strategic leadership that would be able to manage
such stretch. Such kind of system thinking elevated at the leadership
level would encourage to revisit the strategic agency and governance of
collective action. If one has attended J.March leadership classes or
read (March and Weil 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March2003&#34;&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;), one could find such
behavioural leadership with fictional characters as Don Quixote:
foolishness benefits his journey in some ways.
The concept of behavioural strategy (Powell, Lovallo, and Fox

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Powell2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;) proposes also to integrate the views of
reductionist, pluralist and contextualist research. Despite the
attractiveness of such consolidated and holistic construct, management
requires to design concepts that explain collective action in
organizations and at best would be actionable in practice. As suggested
by the authors, it is as the crossroads we can build a comprehensive
understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, in order to make a case for supportive capabilities required for
exploration and exploitation, and combination of both, the behavioural
perspective calls for some architectural design of adaptive systems for
the organization as mentioned by J.March. The contribution of innovative
practices, generative processes or how they are impacted remains to be
clarified. It is a limitation of the problem-based view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also invites us to deeply understand the mechanisms of both
exploration and exploitation and the associated dualism (Farjoun
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Farjoun2010&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;). The paradoxical tension between regimes
describes the adaptive system performance with an inverted U-shape
between the degree of adaptiveness and the frequency of turbulence of
the environment(Posen and Levinthal &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Posen2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;). It
prescribes then adjustments to the organization sustaining exploration
and exploitation, and questions where and how arbitration should be
made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How should be structured the firm? How does leadership should design
accordingly to support innovation and performance? What makes
exploration and what makes the tension points when exploiting its
outcomes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, we could say that we have two major models, one that would be
structural and another one more processual. To organize collective
action in the firm, it is also crucial to keep an eye on learning
patterns, if exploration or exploitation contributes to core rigidities
and incompetencies (Leonard-Barton &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Leonard-Barton1992&#34;&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;;
Dougherty &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Dougherty1995&#34;&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;organizational-ambidexterity-organizing-unbounded-problem-solving&#34;&gt;Organizational ambidexterity: organizing unbounded problem-solving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, we propose to cover the stream of literature focused on
the approach to capture behavioural roots through organizational
structure and design. Some hints of this research program can be found
echoing portfolio project management or program management, and
coordination &amp;amp; communication means deployed across the organization in
relationship with learning mechanisms when competing for primacy (James
G March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;, 84):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Similarly, multiple, independent projects may have an advantage over
a single, coordinated effort. The average result from independent
projects is likely to be lower than that realized from a coordinated
one, but their right-hand side variability can compensate for the
reduced mean in a competition for primacy. The argument can be
extended more generally to the effects of close collaboration or
cooperative information exchange. Organizations that develop effective
instruments of coordination and communication probably can be expected
to do better (on average) than those that are more loosely coupled,
and they also probably can be expected to become more reliable, less
likely to deviate significantly from the mean of their performance
distributions. The price of reliability, however, is a smaller chance
of primacy among competitors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The literature on organizational ambidexterity made the effort over
several decades to capture the relationship between the constructs of
exploration and exploitation with respect to several other observables:
different level of analysis within the firm, influence of the
environment, leadership and many more (Birkinshaw and Gupta

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Birkinshaw2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;; O’Reilly and Tushman

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-OReilly2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;). The numerous variables are usually studied
through quantitative methodologies with surveys and databases.
Correlations and patterns are then derived in relationship with the
firm’s performance and innovation. Ways of organizing ambidexterity are
typified with different impacts given a set of control variables
centralizing most of debates in the field, and may have led to
contradictions because of control variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    We first review the different forms of organizational ambidexterity and
influence of performance and innovation, and what are the capabilities
addressed in such domains. Second, as the core issue remains the
management of competing objectives, we analyse the literature on
paradoxes and how it contributes to organizing collective action.
Finally, given the extant literature and limitations raised by the
community of researchers we come back to the underlying mechanisms and
the necessity to understand the micro-foundations of exploration and
exploitation and nuances that may have been omitted.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;structural-sequential-and-contextual-ambidexterity&#34;&gt;Structural, sequential and contextual ambidexterity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;ldquo;ambidexterity&amp;rdquo; preceded the seminal paper of (James G March

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;em&gt;The ambidextrous organization: Designing
dual structures for innovation&lt;/em&gt; (Duncan 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Duncan1976&#34;&gt;1976&lt;/a&gt;). The
concept was introduced for organization design to improve innovation
capabilities. It makes an assumption on the innovation process seen in
two sequential phases: initiation and implementation. Robert Duncan
stresses the behavioural dimensions (resistance model mainly) and the
decision-making associated to the innovation process. The so-called
&lt;strong&gt;structural ambidexterity&lt;/strong&gt; is designed to facilitate the management of
ill-structured problems posed by innovation&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Given several
behavioural features analysed, three conditional rules are prescribed
for the organizational structure given the nature of innovation
(uncertainty, radicality, need). Merging the literature of dynamic
capabilities and organizational ambidexterity (O’Reilly and Tushman

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-OReilly2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;) also emphasizes the importance of senior
management to oversee the trade-offs of exploration/exploitation and the
translation of &lt;em&gt;sensing, seizing and reconfiguring&lt;/em&gt; (Teece

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Teece2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;). Simultaneity is achieved by the structural
organization of exploration and exploitation. The dynamic capabilities
emerge from the contribution of senior management being able to oversee
the overall reconfiguration of both regimes: a strategic intent with
clear vision and values and the necessity to have ambidextrous
leadership. This attraction for leadership and senior teams is given
because of the risk of ambiguity of capabilities (O’Reilly and Tushman

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-OReilly2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, 190):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is needed is the identification of specific senior team
behaviours and organizational processes/routines that allow firms to
manipulate resources into new value creating strategies. Ambidexterity
as a dynamic capability is not itself a source of competitive
advantage but facilitates new resource configurations that can offer a
competitive advantage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way of organizing is given for high strategic importance and
operational leverage by opposition to other configurations: independent
business unit, internalization/sub-contracting and spin-off. It is an
answer to the ad-hoc/spin-out emerging business see in the innovator’s
dilemma (Christensen 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Christensen1997&#34;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;). The critical
dimension of this stream is the contribution of a potential ambidextrous
leadership from the top management and middle management (Benner and
Tushman 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Benner2003&#34;&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Benner2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;). However, its
nature and means of action are not specified.
The &lt;strong&gt;sequential ambidexterity&lt;/strong&gt; approaches the question of innovation
and continuous change with. The sequential approach is more influenced
by a continuous change perspective (Brown and Eisenhardt

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Brown1997&#34;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;). Brown and Eisenhardt bring the nuance of change
in a more dynamic and continuous way contrasting with punctuated
equilibrium. When considering the shift from exploration to exploitation
(the opposite is rarely mentioned), they emphasize the importance of
experimentation and light structure (&lt;em&gt;semi-structure&lt;/em&gt;). It is a &lt;em&gt;weaker&lt;/em&gt;
form and blending the edges of the short burst of radical/discontinuous
change in between long periods of incremental change&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Focusing on
processes and systems allows to have an alternative approach to the
structural dimension of ambidexterity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Continuously changing organizations are likely to be complex adaptive
systems with semi-structures that poise the organization on the edge
of order and chaos and links in time that force simultaneous attention
and linkage among past, present, and future. These organizations seem
to grow over time through a series of sequenced steps, and they are
associated with success in highly competitive, high-velocity
environments.&lt;/em&gt;(Brown and Eisenhardt 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Brown1997&#34;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;, 32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contextual ambidexterity&lt;/strong&gt; brought another modulation that tends to
merge the structural dimension with the punctuated equilibrium by
(Gibson and Birkinshaw 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Gibson2004&#34;&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, 209):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;contextual because it arises from features of its organizational
context. Contextual ambidexterity is the behavioural capacity to
simultaneously demonstrate alignment and adaptability across an entire
business unit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influence of context opens up the perspective on organizational
ambidexterity by considering the boundary condition of the construct:
environment dynamics. It also moves away from the trade-off allocation
problem by &lt;em&gt;simultaneously develop[ing] these capacities by aligning
themselves around adaptability&lt;/em&gt; (Gibson and Birkinshaw

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Gibson2004&#34;&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, 221). The interplay between adaptability and
alignment is placed at the individual level, calling for paradoxes at
the local level, in addition to support from senior management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The three models described try to organize in different way the
separation and balance between exploration and exploitation. The
non-mutual conditioning is maintained: exploration and exploitation
regimes happen in sequence, in parallel and at different levels and
contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systematically, top management and its leadership is required to oversee
and manage the balance, in addition to enabling some level of
flexibility for transitioning dynamically. Yet, it does reveal the
actual practice and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;limitations-of-organizational-ambidexterity-models&#34;&gt;Limitations of organizational ambidexterity models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors have also highlighted the push from academic reviewers during
their publishing process. Their qualitative study would indeed bring
more depth to the construct of ambidexterity and separation between
exploration/exploitation. They were encouraged to embrace the literature
of organizational ambidexterity with (Birkinshaw and Gupta

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Birkinshaw2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, 288):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interestingly, our original focus in this paper was not on
ambidexterity per se. Our specific interest was in the tension between
an organization’s capacities for alignment and adaptability, and in
the role of organizational context to help it achieve an appropriate
level of balance between the two. In developing the paper, we came
across ambidexterity as one possible framing for our work, and we
leaned heavily on Adler and colleagues (1999) in our theorizing. But
it was actually the editor, Marshall Schminke, who had the bright idea
to describe the phenomenon we observed as contextual ambidexterity, as
distinct from the more structure-oriented approach to ambidexterity
that Duncan (1976) and Tushman and O’Reilly (1996) had described.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the amount of quantitative studies, the extensive
literature reviews conducted by major authors (who have contributed with
detailed qualitative or mixed studies (Benner and Tushman

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Benner2003&#34;&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;; Gibson and Birkinshaw 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Gibson2004&#34;&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;))
in the field have called for further qualitative research and trying to
surface underlying processes supporting ambidexterity in action
(Birkinshaw and Gupta 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Birkinshaw2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, 332):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How they actually do this is seldom addressed in the research on
ambidexterity but is at the core of the leadership challenge. What do
the interfaces of the old and new need to look like? How can leaders
manage the inevitable conflicts that arise? More qualitative and
in-depth studies are required to answer these questions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a call to reconnect with behavioural roots and to better specify
the practice of exploration/exploitation and its management beyond pure
trade-off as if they were on the same continuum. Quantitative studies
have failed in specifying such phenomena:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Although the results are not completely consistent across studies, in
general they confirm that structural ambidexterity consists of
autonomous structural units for exploration and exploitation, targeted
integration to leverage assets, an overarching vision to legitimate
the need for exploration and exploitation, and leadership that is
capable of managing the tensions associated with multiple
organizational alignments&lt;/em&gt; (O’Reilly and Tushman

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-OReilly2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, 328)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At a high level of abstraction, it is easy to claim that firms shift
structures between exploitative and exploratory modes—but what would
this mean at ground level? Major structural transitions can be highly
disruptive. What does it mean to go from exploitation to exploration,
or the reverse? Here the research is not fine-grained enough to
provide much insight.&lt;/em&gt;(O’Reilly and Tushman 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-OReilly2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;,
327)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We know some organizations are more ambidextrous than others, but for
this insight to be valuable we have to take a more detailed look at
the way they make their decisions, who gets involved in those
decisions, and how those decisions are implemented. For me, this is
one of the areas where ambidexterity research has the most potential.
There is, for example, some research looking at decision processes in
top management teams (Smith &amp;amp; Tushman, 2005) and how executives
embrace paradox (Andriopoulos &amp;amp; Lewis,2009), but I would like to see a
lot more.&lt;/em&gt; (Birkinshaw and Gupta 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Birkinshaw2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, 293)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to note the interest of leadership, which had raised
as a reaction with respect to the &lt;em&gt;awakening of the machines&lt;/em&gt; that
Herbert Simon dreamed of. Stanley Stark (Stark 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Stark1963&#34;&gt;1963&lt;/a&gt;)
in his review on creative leadership mentions the work Philippe
Selznick’s of administrations through leadership (Selznick

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Selznick1957&#34;&gt;1957&lt;/a&gt;), here is a stimulating extract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did Professor Selznick write this particular essay? And why did
he title it Leadership in Administration? Any reply to the first
question should include, I believe, a statement to the following
effect: he wrote it as an intuitivist supplement, corrective, or
antithesis to the formalist essay that Herbert A. Simon titled
Administrative behaviour. And any reply to the second question should
include, I believe, a statement to the following effect: leadership in
the old-fashioned sense, which stood so high with the intuitivist
likes of Plato, Carlyle, and Weber, stands very low in the world of
scientific empiricism; in Administrative behaviour&amp;hellip; the word
leadership itself cannot be found in the heading of a single chapter,
chapter section, chapter subsection, or anywhere in the index. &amp;hellip; My
guess is that Professor Simon would wonder much, and that Professor
Selznick would find it exceedingly difficult to satisfy him. But we
must satisfy him if we are ever to convince him that at any given time
the computer is not doing all the thinking that middle or upper
managers do. For example, when he says that “we will have the
technical capability, by 1985, to manage corporations by machine”
(1960, p. 52), are we entitled to smugly retort, “Sure, but what about
leading, creatively leading—a la Selznick—by machine?” if we cannot
reach agreement on what Professor Selznick means? It is one thing to
say to Professor Simon— “You’ve left creative leadership out of your
social psychology and out of your machine” — and another to
demonstrate that he has omitted a piece of reality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership is presented as a counterforce and extension of bounded
rationality and technologies of organizing to reach optima. The
decisions, the vision given by leadership remains to be specified.
When comparing the structural and processual models (Benner and Tushman

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Benner2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;; Birkinshaw and Gupta

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Birkinshaw2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;), the contextual approach encourages to look
at the business environment, not only at business unit level but in a
more general perspective. With innovation management, organization may
have to adapt in different ways, as it can shift the performance
frontier of exploration and exploitation. Mary Benner suggests the
innovation locus (Lakhani, Lifshitz-Assaf, and Tushman

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lakhani2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;) having shifted and being shaped in different
ways (e.g. open innovation, community-based, exploratory partnerships),
the ambidextrous organization should be revised as the adaptive process
may no longer rely on &lt;em&gt;models based on cost minimization, local search,
hierarchy, power, control of contingencies, and extrinsic motivation&lt;/em&gt;
(Benner and Tushman 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Benner2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;, 508). It is interesting to
note that this in-between concept, sheds a fresh light on fixations and
path-dependency of some constructs that are showing limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in (Gupta, Smith, and Shalley 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Gupta2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, 699),
the system design with its engineering background on modularity
(Henderson and Clark 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Henderson1990&#34;&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;) brings another way of
contextualizing ambidexterity given the system architecture and
innovation. Exploration activities can be conducted locally for a
module, and exploitation can carry on in others as long as interfaces
remain stable. The coupling between modules may also an obstacle to such
approaches as explained in (Benner and Tushman 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Benner2003&#34;&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;,
247).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exploration and exploitation non-mutual conditioning may be then
challenged by innovation practices and loci. The decision-making and
managerial capacity (e.g. leadership) are not fully elucidated in the
literature and would require fine-grained qualitative research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way of considering the balancing of the dichotomy between
exploration and exploitation, is to look at how the literature on
paradoxes have nurtured a way of managing collective action (Smith and
Lewis &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Smith2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;). It would allow considering the
antagonistic effects with different main performance criteria
(generation of alternatives, and efficiency of choice).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;managing-with-paradoxes&#34;&gt;Managing with paradoxes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizational ambidexterity literature with its organization
adaptation for innovation and efficiency plays with translation of the
underlying adaptive process articulated with exploration/exploitation.
Researchers in the field have already stressed its limitations and calls
for future research. Their synthesis calls for forms of ambidextrous
leadership (O’Reilly and Tushman 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-OReilly2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;) or at least a
crucial involvement of senior management to oversee forms of
structural/sequential/contextual ambidexterity. For a manager it will
imply then allocating resources for a regime or the other in different
ways in space and time. From a behavioural perspective, the manager will
bear the paradoxes associated with the co-existence of these regimes or
inversely will manage other individuals with such paradoxes (Papachroni,
Heracleous, and Paroutis 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Papachroni2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to multiplicity of studies, their nature, their unit of analysis,
the triggered paradoxes would be of different types when looking at the
critical literature review of (Gupta, Smith, and Shalley

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Gupta2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;) in their special research forum. For instance,
the definition of exploration and exploitation may depend on the unit of
analysis chosen in the studies (multi-scale problem), the continuity or
orthogonality of the two constructs, the system dimension opposed to
organization and individual, interpersonal learning, tacit knowledge,
inter-dependencies and local/distant search. They also specify that
learning mechanisms associated with exploration or exploitation may of
be different nature, as it was confirmed in (Garcias, Dalmasso, and
Sardas 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Garcias2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;). Paradoxes then bring the promise of
blending the dichotomy in a distributed way dependent on context.
For instance, (Leonard-Barton 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Leonard-Barton1992&#34;&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;) reveals
the paradox of new product development managers having to rely on
existing core capabilities and still avoid associated core rigidities:
e.g. values, skills and knowledge, managerial systems and technical
systems. Paradoxes for project management were handled with different
strategies associated with adaptive limitations: abandonment,
recidivism, reorientation and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But paradoxes can also be embraced to manage a firm specially for senior
management (Smith and Tushman 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Smith2005&#34;&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;) who can overview
the numerous organizational tensions (Smith and Lewis

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Smith2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;). Teams arrangements, communication, leadership
coaching contribute to adopting and managing the paradoxes in a &lt;em&gt;dynamic
equilibrium&lt;/em&gt; in order to avoid the fatality of cyclical patterns
associated to paradoxes. For instance, (Smith and Lewis

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Smith2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;, 392) proposes that some individuals with
cognitive/behavioural complexity and emotional equanimity are likely to
accept paradoxical tensions instead of defending. It is an invitation to
dig into the constraints to better twist the paradoxes into managerial
action. The unit of analysis to cope with organizational tensions may
also be translated in different action registers as demonstrated in
(O’Dwyer, Sweeney, and Cormican 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-ODwyer2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;) with project
portfolio ambidexterity. CEOs are found to be using practices based on
paradoxes to drive performance and innovation in firms (Fredberg

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Fredberg2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite the attractiveness of paradox theory as an alternative
to contingency approaches, the work of Linda Putnam in (Cunha and Putnam

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Cunha2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;) addresses the potential paradox of a success
trap for this vigorous literature: the paradox of the paradox. Two
issues retained our attention: the imprecision of the word and the
paradox reversibility while being a problem/tool to manage. For our
concern, as we question the possibility of actually organizing
collective action through the paradoxes of ambidextrous tensions, its
practice may become very diffuse and hard to grasp. Furthermore, the
tensions created by these &lt;em&gt;stretch goals&lt;/em&gt; (Sitkin et al.

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Sitkin2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;) may be favoured in some organizational contexts
but it also raises the question of the ambidextrous individual able to
cope with such &lt;em&gt;double binds&lt;/em&gt; (Holmqvist and Spicer

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Holmqvist2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;). The concept of double-bind thinking,
introduced by Gregory Bateson (Bateson et al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Bateson1956&#34;&gt;1956&lt;/a&gt;,

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Bateson1963&#34;&gt;1963&lt;/a&gt;) may encourage some kind of schizophrenia or at
least high level of stress among individuals subject to such
organizational tensions. Others may be more successful. Such unbalanced
performance for ambidextrous strategy and leadership encourages to dig a
little further into the cognitive level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, in (Laureiro-Martínez et al.

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Laureiro-Martinez2015a&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;), magnetic resonance imaging is
performed on individuals to identify brain regions supporting the
decision-making associated with exploration/exploitation and its
trade-off. The findings include the awareness of the environment of
decision-making, the influence of emotion and attention, the sequencing
and switch of the two regimes, and learning mechanisms. The authors
insist on the fact that their results do not encourage any form of
selection and hiring but rather on the training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the contributions of the MIT’s System Thinking department’s
director Peter Senge (Senge 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Senge1990&#34;&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;) is suggested in the
discussion of (Leonard-Barton 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Leonard-Barton1992&#34;&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;, 192). He
calls in his paper for heuristics associated with leadership styles
supporting a generative learning instead of adaptive learning. The
leader could have new roles to support the tensions and organizational
learning; leader as a designer, teacher and steward. The associated
skills and management tools should then be developed, and would allow
extending the model of adaptive learning with creation process in the
continuity of coping mechanisms with a broader system thinking. This
view of managerial action recalls also the works of (Starbuck

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Starbuck1983&#34;&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt;) considering organizations as action
generators. So, instead of relying on the individual skills to cope with
cognitive ambidexterity and associated strain, the focus could be
shifted toward methods, practices and management technologies as well as
organizational routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the paradox approach may leave us without clear means of
understanding the practice of organizational ambidexterity, as it tends
to distribute the paradox on multi-scale and phenomena fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By following the lines suggested for future research in the
ambidexterity literature reviews referenced previously, we propose to
take a closer look at the decision-making process for exploration,
exploitation and its trade-off. It may for instance document what is
expected from leadership specially if they engage in generative
practices shifting the frontiers of exploration and exploitation. So
far, we have highlighted that macro-level analysis may be insufficient
and rather too contingent, hence our need to explicit the underlying
mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;deciding-to-innovate-micro-foundations-of-ambidextrous-organizations&#34;&gt;Deciding to innovate: micro-foundations of ambidextrous organizations?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this final section of the chapter, we propose to analyse the
literature on decision-making supporting exploration and exploitation.
First of all, the necessity of managing the adaptive process through
exploration and exploitation was presented as a necessity to cope with
externalities and sustainability. Along with the firm’s performance,
innovation management has become the central focus of ambidexterity as
it contributes to exploration/exploitation impact and trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm’s management decides then to innovate to feed the adaptive
process with exploration regime which then requires to be transferred to
exploitation purposes. We have stressed that these two regimes can
structurally co-exist, be sequenced dynamically and more importantly may
be shaped in different ways depending on the unit of analysis
(organization, system and individual/cognitive).
Relying on the decision-making process in a &lt;em&gt;neo-Carnegie way&lt;/em&gt; (Gavetti,
Levinthal, and Ocasio 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Gavetti2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;), i.e. looping back with
the behavioural roots of (James G March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;),
encourages to specify decision-making with respect to exploration,
exploitation and its balance. Decisions are considered as legitimate
unit of analysis. It is tracker of sociology of organizations (Crozier
and Friedberg 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Crozier1977&#34;&gt;1977&lt;/a&gt;; Pettigrew

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Pettigrew1973&#34;&gt;1973&lt;/a&gt;; J. March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991a&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;), perhaps
even an artificial construct (Laroche 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Laroche1995&#34;&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;) for
which we should perhaps prefer organizational action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Without opposing decision and course of action, we will have to look at
the impact of risk, uncertainty and the unknown as we tasked ourselves
to regard adaptive process with respect to innovation management. The
following paragraphs will aim at clarifying the nature of
decision-making in our chosen field of study and how it handles the
dichotomy and balance of both exploration and exploitation.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;uncertainty-and-the-unknown&#34;&gt;Uncertainty and the unknown&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the assumptions made by (James G March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;), the
problem space given to the firm to adapt to survive was set beforehand:
exploration was a means to search for alternatives not considered by
exploitation in the given problem space. However, the previous
paragraphs on organizational ambidexterity and the focus on exploration
preceding exploitation, gave several hints that the search could be more
complex than the one originally defined by James March. Several keywords
challenge what makes adaptiveness such as: unusual experiences, new
locus of innovation with open innovation, environment awareness, system
thinking, differences in learning mechanisms for exploration and
exploitation and the adjective generative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, the problem space involved statistical and optimization
dimensions for the decision-maker. In other words, statistical learning
and subjective beliefs that could be modelled in terms of probabilities.
We are in the realm of risk-taking and uncertainty. The consequences of
decisions are known but the probability of happening is not known. The
search-model of exploration consists in looking at other consequences
and decisions to enlighten the decision-maker by having the global
picture of the problem instead of being bounded. By referring again to
earlier definitions (Levinthal and March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Levinthal1993&#34;&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt;,
105), the research developments suggest that exploration encourages to
specify the regime of generation or generativity of new knowledge in its
broadest sense: &lt;em&gt;[exploration] the pursuit of new knowledge, of things
that might come to be known&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;[exploitation] the use and
development of things already known&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If new knowledge is generated by experiences (changing environment) or
deliberate experimentation and action, the rational choice theory
reference&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is no longer fully valid as we force the set of
possibilities to become larger and potentially reconfigured (Hey

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hey1983&#34;&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt;). We enter the realm of the unknown or unknowledge
as suggested by G.L.S Shackle (Shackle 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Shackle1949&#34;&gt;1949&lt;/a&gt;; Frowen

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Frowen1990&#34;&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the field of operations research, (Ozdemir and Saaty

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ozdemir2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;) proposes to add a variable labelled &amp;ldquo;Unknown&amp;rdquo;
with uncertain probability; the model can then be used for
decision-making and take into account the perception of the unknown. In
other words, the &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; states of the universe of probabilities are
integrated, so it means really re-examine the full extent of the
theoretical, objective and unbounded problem by opposition to the
rationally bounded one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not an actual theorization of the Unknown as we have defined it:
states of nature and decisions that we are fully unaware of it but that
only action can reveal. The dynamic dimension of decision-making
naturally updates the sets of choices, consequences, and utility
function but decision theories rarely focus on this feature because of
potential problems of dynamic consistency, modelling complexity and
preference revelation given choices made (Machina

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Machina1989&#34;&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt;; Chabris, Laibson, and Schuldt

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Chabris2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing issue dragging behaviours such as patience and impulsivity
are not really our concern despite being also part of life in
organizations. We are rather interested in what could be willingly
generated in a static frame: changing belief, new decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from a decision problem to another invites us to consider the
generative function that allows the transfer between the two. It is an
expansive projection by opposition to traditional projection reducing
the scope (se
Fig.&lt;a href=&#34;#fig:projectionexpansion&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;fig:projectionexpansion&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;
below). In other words, it is not reducing uncertainty over time with
numerous means of actions (Sommer, Loch, and Pich

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Sommer2008&#34;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;). Instead, shifting from a problem to another
increases uncertainty temporarily before further experimentations can be
performed (e.g. testing). Likewise, the need-solution pairs developed in
(Hippel and Krogh 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-VonHippel2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;), stresses the existence
and discovery of new problems and opens a field for how to behave in
such unknown landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such behaviour has been studied in cognitive psychology where the
avoidance and search for the unknown can be channelled through the
curiosity and regret (Dijk and Zeelenberg 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-VanDijk2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;).
Based on information-gap theory (Ben-Haim 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ben-Haim2006a&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;),
it proposes a first step to consider known unknowns (Rumsfeld

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Rumsfeld2002&#34;&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Rumsfeld2002&#34;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;,

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Rumsfeld2002a&#34;&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Rumsfeld2002a&#34;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;), but double unknowns
again are not part of the equation. The case of Black Swans (Taleb

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Taleb2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;) and the types of uncertainties associated with
knowledge categories can bring a new light on the decision-making
process (Faulkner, Feduzi, and Runde 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Faulkner2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;). It
helps defining with more clarity the boundary conditions of
expected-utility theories which presuppose what is known and uncertain,
compared to other theories such as non-expected utility ones (Machina

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Machina2010&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Machina1989&#34;&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt;; Starmer

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Starmer2000&#34;&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;; Quiggin 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Quiggin2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;). But, they
still lack in sensing and seizing double unknowns despite revealing a
number of interesting behavioural features that could contribute to the
generation of new knowledge and choices. They refer to phenomena such
as: preferences reversal, dynamic inconsistency, anticipation,
optimism/pessimism, regret, that call for mathematical models that are
not additive in the classical sense.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The literature on decision-making with respect to exploration and
exploitation, stresses the importance of generative learning and the
frontier with the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decisions and search of new alternatives can be of different nature,
hence changing the nature of exploration and consequently of future
exploitation. We must study in more detail the edges of the Pareto front
and its potential crossing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose then to study the interplay between search relieving bounded
rationality (known) and generation of new knowledge reconfiguring
problem formulation and solving (unknown).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;generative-processes-creativity-engineering-and-design&#34;&gt;Generative processes: creativity, engineering and design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploration distinguishes itself from exploitation by introducing a way
of reasoning that is quite challenging for it. We propose to take a
closer look at the generative phenomenon and how it is translated in
practice to support exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of generating alternatives with a background of theory of
creativity was introduced by the works of Robert Epstein. He proposed a
&lt;em&gt;weaker&lt;/em&gt; definition of creativity, namely generativity, to study how
animals would engage in creative problem solving (Epstein et al.

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Epstein1984&#34;&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt;). With his colleagues, he put forward that
pigeons would engage in actions helping them to gain insight to solve
the problem in a novel way. In that sense, we are close to the
novelty-search algorithm mentioned previously (Nguyen, Yosinski, and
Clune 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Nguyen2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;; Cully et al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Cully2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;).
Generativity is the distinctive feature of design theory and practices.
Designers engage in jotting, sketching, drawing, writing and speaking
(Brun, Le Masson, and Weil 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Brun2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;; Goldschmidt

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Goldschmidt1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;; Ferguson 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ferguson1992&#34;&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;; Goel

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Goel1995&#34;&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;). All of the tasks, that could also be seen as
micro-decisions, contribute to idea generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the emergence of brainstorming (Osborn and Rona

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Osborn1959&#34;&gt;1959&lt;/a&gt;) coming from advertisement and the large
contributions of cognitive and group psychology (Guilford

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Guilford1967&#34;&gt;1967&lt;/a&gt;; Amabile et al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Amabile1996a&#34;&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;)
numerous managerial practices have been prescribed to support innovation
in organizations (Amabile 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Amabile1988&#34;&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt;). Our aim is not to
make an exhaustive survey of available practices, but rather to identify
the performance discriminants of generative processes supporting
exploration and eventually efficiency exploitation. It will help us in
better understanding what causes and follows a generative process,
i.e. the &amp;ldquo;operator&amp;rdquo; that supports the discovery of new knowledge, that
allows making our way through the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;design-thinking&#34;&gt;Design Thinking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last two-three decades, Design Thinking has become the centre of
attention for numerous companies and consultancy firms (IDEO,
Continuum). Looking back at its origins at Stanford’s School of
Engineering, the director of Product Design (Faste

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Faste1994&#34;&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;) stresses the need to teach young engineers to
ambidextrous thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The gestation of Ambidextrous Thinking has occurred both in a College
of Visual and Performing Arts (Syracuse University) and a School of
Engineering (Stanford University). Thinking in the former setting is
often characterized as being soft and fuzzy, in the latter, cold and
hard. These characterizations are impediments to understanding the
nature of design process. The central mission of Ambidextrous Thinking
is simply to acquaint engineering students with the full range of
their human potential in order to encourage a more balanced and potent
approach to problem solving. In so doing it demonstrates the important
connections between these seeming opposites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several techniques are taught to students to deal with reasoning
trespassing traditional analytical thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many of the techniques pioneered in this class are showing up in
local research and design firms. Examples include mind-mapping,
scenario improvisation and story-boarding. I believe there is more to
this than the efficacy of the techniques students are bringing with
them to the work place. With the introduction of electronics,
increasing numbers of products are as much about the design of desired
behaviours as they are with the delivery of utilitarian function. Sole
reliance on analytical skills will not guarantee engineering success
in the increasingly consumer oriented marketplace, nor will it help
engineers process the overwhelming amount of information that they
will be facing in their careers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design Thinking has evolved in a methodological toolbox to democratize
design to all individuals in a wide variety of contexts (firm, public
institutions, associations and classrooms). It tends to challenge design
as a profession (Kimbell 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Kimbell2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;,

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Kimbell2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;). However, its underlying generative processes
can be coded to explain engineering in its globality (Mabogunje,
Sonalkar, and Leifer 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Mabogunje2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;). It is powerful and can
be hosted in firms to stimulate new product development at its frond
end, but still raises the question of its performance (Schmiedgen et al.

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Schmiedgen2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;). The task is rather complex as performance
criteria considered for tame problems (in exploitation) are ill-suited
for the wicked problems at stake (Rittel and Webber

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Rittel1973&#34;&gt;1973&lt;/a&gt;; Buchanan 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Buchanan1992&#34;&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the generative phenomenon &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;, or in its simplest form
&amp;ldquo;idea generation&amp;rdquo; (fluency), we should pay attention closely enough to
what supports generativity in the design (thinking) process. For
instance, (Sonalkar, Mabogunje, and Leifer 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Sonalkar2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;)
introduced the &lt;em&gt;Interaction Dynamics Notation&lt;/em&gt; to track &amp;ldquo;concept
generation&amp;rdquo; and a comparison is made against Linkography (Goldschmidt

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Goldschmidt2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;). Their research method stresses how
crucial the expression of an idea is for the individual and
inter-personal relations engaged in the design process. Works in
cognitive psychology from (Smith, Ward, and Schumacher

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Smith1993&#34;&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt;; Ward 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ward2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;,

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ward1994&#34;&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;) have also stressed the decisiveness of knowledge
categories to stimulate idea generation with the notion of &lt;em&gt;fixation
effects&lt;/em&gt; It creates a potential performance reference point for
exploration. Such anchoring could be associated with boundedness, and
requiring a search for other alternative, but also the limitations of
search in a given problem space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;design-theories-and-design-engineering-rules-and-fixations&#34;&gt;Design theories and design engineering: rules and fixations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other approaches originating also from an engineering background have
developed theories to frame the design reasoning in different
universities across the globe under the umbrella of the Design Society.
Currently, C-K theory (Hatchuel and Weil 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hatchuel2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;) has
managed to be general enough to explain other design theories and
practices (Le Masson, Dorst, and Subrahamanian

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeMasson2013a&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;; Agogué and Kazakçı 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Agogue2014b&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;;
Hatchuel, Le Masson, and Weil 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hatchuel2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;). Considering
design theories, with respect to creativity and innovation management
(Le Masson, Weil, and Hatchuel 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeMasson2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;) also allows
extending design theories domains where engineering and product design
have been lacking (Eppinger 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Eppinger2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;). So using design
theories as a reference tool to measure generativity could be an
appropriate instrument. Tracking design fixations relating to cognitive
fixation effects was studied and modelled with C-K theory (Agogué, Le
Masson, and Robinson 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Agogue2012a&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;; Le Masson, Hatchuel, and
Weil 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeMasson2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;; Houdé 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Houde1997&#34;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capacity to avoid fixations, potential traps associated with
exploitation, associated routines, and heuristics appears as a crucial
performance criteria of the generative processes supporting exploration.
The power to defixate will be hold as key to value the richness,
usefulness of exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this performance may be seen as self-destructive or
antithetical for exploitation. They may generate concepts and knowledge
pushing decision-making to its limits and complicating learning
mechanisms. Indeed, these generative processes may be seen as upstream
processes, in the fuzzy front end (Brown and Katz

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Brown2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;; Leifer and Steinert 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Leifer2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;) for
design thinking, as it is the case also for innovative design practices
by opposition to systematic design (Pahl and Beitz

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Pahl2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;) or rule-based design (Le Masson, Hatchuel, and
Weil 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeMasson2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to home base by avoiding spin-off and fully ad-hoc devices
mentioned in organizational ambidexterity encourages to think of how
beliefs and utility (value) are managed to reach the end decision to
innovate. The organizational learning calls for a third loop of learning
(Leifer and Steinert 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Leifer2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;), or a meta-learning (Lei,
Hitt, and Bettis 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lei1996&#34;&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;) extending the single/double-loop
learning (Levitt and March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Levitt1988&#34;&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt;; Argyris and Schön

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Argyris1978&#34;&gt;1978&lt;/a&gt;). Both favour reconfiguring the system in a
wider perspective. It would not be incrementally, nor just between
elements, but rather with underlying categories and descriptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a tangent approach and still without considering the screening issue,
researchers in design management have largely insisted on the vitality
of the creation of meaning to support innovation management through
design practice (Verganti and Dell’Era 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Verganti2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;). In
that perspective, we rally the notion of dynamic punctuated equilibrium
(Brown and Eisenhardt 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Brown1997&#34;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;), where the exploitation is
relieved from strictness to explore with a semi-structure through
different means of experimenting. The necessity of a temporal or
structural handover is blended in the process. This &amp;ldquo;objective&amp;rdquo; of
meaning and stabilization is also clearly described in the works of
Carliss Baldwin with the design rules (Baldwin and Clark

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Baldwin2000&#34;&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;). Rules can then be used as criteria for
decisions, and organize design activities around these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;homo-faberdeux-ex-machina-designing-mutations&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo Faber&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Deux ex machina&lt;/em&gt;: Designing mutations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a perhaps slightly outdated practice (Kesselring, Fritz (VDI

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-KesselringFritzVDI1942&#34;&gt;1942&lt;/a&gt;) stemming from an earlier version of
systematic design (Pahl and Beitz 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Pahl2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;), German
engineers looked at decision-making for product design where the design
process is punctuated by technical and economical evaluation enhanced by
research and idea generation and ad-hoc decisions. He proposes that it
is a means of developing products and also coming up with technical
mutations. The biological analogy is derived from evolutionary theories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finally, the following interesting analogy between the divine act of
creation in nature and the human act of creation in the technology
should be noted. In both cases, from time to time, there is a
discontinuity, apparently without a demonstrable relation to what has
gone before, something new. We call this a &amp;ldquo;biological mutation&amp;rdquo; and
mean by it the realization of a divine idea, the other: &amp;ldquo;technical
mutation&amp;rdquo;, meaning the sudden appearance and the first realization of
a human idea. Just as it is one of the great tasks of biology to
investigate the emergence of mutations in their field, so for us it
must be one of the top guidelines to explore the preconditions for the
emergence of ideas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his paper written during his time at Siemens, he does not develop the
importance of models design to value ideas’ technical/economical
dimensions contributing to the decision process. The idea remains
seductive, as he departs from a classical evolutionary perspective by
the fact he intends to generate mutations. The origin of the mutation,
and its actual process remains to be specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, we have insisted on the necessity to have generative processes
supporting exploration in the sense they should generate alternatives.
Fluency is key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the ability to defixate is important to value alternatives
differing from those at reach in exploitation regime. Methods and models
are required to support such process that is not as straightforward due
to biases and heuristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, a corollary, to counter isolation of exploration (James G March
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;), generative processes should look at avoiding
concepts being a wildcard in the game of exploration/exploitation
trade-off. Specially for decision-making and the meaning creation as the
beliefs and utilities may be twisted depending on the course of action
and life of the concept in the firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we see that exploration can be of two different orders and
interacting with exploitation in the realm of what is known but also
with the unknown. Such interplay brings new complexities for
decision-making due to problem-formulation. It raises also new questions
for organizational learning and adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing generative processes, managing design and its impact on
exploitation routines (problem-solving, decision-making) requires
overcoming the core performances of fluency and defixation. In (James G
March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;; Dong, March, and Workiewicz

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Dong2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;), he advocated that the volume of ideas,
technologies, ventures is a necessity in the spirit of technologies of
foolishness without explaining the tension and selection between
explored and exploited alternatives. So far, we have developed through
the literature the necessity to manage the trade-off of
exploration/exploitation, and each regime individually, with an emphasis
that the trick lies in exploration and its transition. Generative
processes would be the engine of exploration and simultaneously
complexify its articulation with exploitation. We have specified that
deciding to innovate implies revisiting the decision-making process. How
could this distance be reduced? The question becomes then how to manage
generativity and how to manage design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;managing-design&#34;&gt;Managing design&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of the leader as a designer had already been introduced (Senge

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Senge1990&#34;&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;), and recent works have also stressed that
managers should not be only focused on decision-making but perhaps
should be designers (Boland and Collopy 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Boland2004&#34;&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;). If the
firm is fully design-oriented do we avoid decisions? Either way,
collective action will be organized in some way and will contribute to
the purpose of the firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The locus of Design in the firm and interactions with other departments
is rather critical to understand its impact. When surveying the role of
industrial design in British firms (Gorb and Dumas

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Gorb1987&#34;&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt;), Angela Dumas in her years at the London Business
School’s Centre for Design Management, revisiting the notion of design
given by Simon’s definition where Design departs from Science: &lt;em&gt;Everyone
who designs devises a course of action aimed at changing existing
situations into preferred ones&lt;/em&gt; (Simon 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Simon1996&#34;&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;). Instead
of only focusing the artificial dimension of design, i.e. development of
an artefact, A.Dumas and P.Gorb insist on the system of artefacts and
how individuals interact with such system. Design’s definition is
extended to take into account the managerial and behavioural dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;a course of action for the development of an artefact or a system of
artefacts; including the series of organizational activities required
to achieve that development&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They show that design occurs in a silent form already across the firm
despite not being recognized as such: professional designers, design
department etc. If design exists in a diffuse way across, so it means
that we could have a way to articulate the generative processes’ outputs
with existing routines as individuals engage in design in their own way
and domain. For Design Thinking practice, several tools used that fall
in the categories of need-finding, idea generation and idea testing
(Seidel and Fixson 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Seidel2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;) will bring limitations and
support other practices. Anyhow, several ad-hoc management tools and
practices have to be implemented to link this exploration practice with
product development for instance (Beyhl, Berg, and Giese

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Beyhl2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;; Beyhl and Giese 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Beyhl2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of prototyping appears crucial to implement Design Thinking
(Holloway 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Holloway2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;; Stigliani and Ravasi

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Stigliani2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;). Klaus Krippendorff largely contributed to
the importance of artefacts and the associated semantic turn
(Krippendorff 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Krippendorff1989&#34;&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt;). In a similar way, Angela
Dumas (Dumas 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Dumas1994&#34;&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;) stressed the importance of relying
and building &lt;em&gt;totems&lt;/em&gt; through metaphor-making in product development as
it can engage the ‘silent designers’ (Dumas and Mintzberg

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Dumas1989&#34;&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Dumas1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;) to revisit the
decision-making process altogether around these totems. Based on a case
on shoe design, here is a totem example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The result is a set of slides, caricatures, and words that represents
the product family - this is the totem. Most of the shoe
manufacturer’s teams produced totems consisting of a phrase and a
slide, or a slide and a caricature. While totems can include several
slides, caricatures, and phrases, it is important that they combine to
form a simple and memorable metaphor, and this is often best achieved
with just one or two phrases and images.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to totems call for a (too) short digression on the works of
Emile Durkheim (Durkheim 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Durkheim1915&#34;&gt;1915&lt;/a&gt;). He reveals how
religion is social phenomenon, pushing aside the traditional sacred
dimension on the back seat, and insisting rather on the collective
consciousness built around totems. If we allowed us such detour, it is
because of the works of André Orléan on the notion of &amp;ldquo;value&amp;rdquo; in
economics (Orléan 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Orlean&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;). He proposes that the value
should not be considered as a substance in itself driven by work value
and subjective utility in economics models, but rather stemming from the
market economy where producers and buyers (exchangers) meet to trade
goods. So it is the circulation that makes value and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;managing-meaning-and-making-sense-of-the-unknown&#34;&gt;Managing meaning and making sense of the unknown&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These notions of meaning and value around the unknown shaped by
generative processes encourage to manage generativity through its social
dimension that crystallizes around the decision-making, the learning,
the sharing and the diffusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could then engage design in the firm through the cultural impact
(Buchanan 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Buchanan2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;) by supposing that design is more
mindset enhancing daily concerns. The trick is also to reach out for all
&lt;em&gt;silent designers&lt;/em&gt; if we follow the spirit of democratizing design and
creativity. Design Thinking has proposed that the empathy building for
users could support a design thinking culture within the firm (Elsbach
and Stigliani 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Elsbach2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;). Based on the literature on
organizational routines, the trick is also to be able to frame Design
Thinking within the firm. It appears crucial (Carlgren, Rauth, and
Elmquist 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Carlgren2016a&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;) as it can become in many different
forms and relying on different set of tools. Several themes can be
identified: User focus, Problem framing, Visualization, Experimentation
and Diversity. They all involve principles, practices and mindsets. The
latter will contribute to its culture which can be even more enforced
through management education and wide training programs (Dunne and
Martin 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Dunne2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;; Martin 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Martin2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;). Yet,
reaching institutionalization may not be the only key to let innovative
design develop and be sustainable in the firm due to key players: silent
designers (Dumas and Mintzberg 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Dumas1989&#34;&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt;). They are those
who engage in some generative processes on a daily basis with, for, or
against rational-based technologies (management technologies, routines,
communication channels, meetings, gates etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, making decisions and their formalization may be not key in
early phases of generativity because of the lack of shared understanding
and belief. The middle-ground between generated concepts and social
system is the place where they simultaneously shape each other (Akrich
et al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Akrich2002&#34;&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;). Individual will gradually gain interest
(&lt;em&gt;intéressement&lt;/em&gt;) that can eventually sustain innovation management,
without focusing on the rationality of decisions [(Mintzberg and
Westley 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Mintzberg2001&#34;&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;)]&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This analytical lens leads to
how sensemaking (Weick, Sutcliffe, and Obstfeld 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Weick2005&#34;&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;)
can contribute to managing the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of product innovation, some works have stressed the
sensemaking for product innovation showing that its system have
different dynamic compared with non-innovative contexts (Dougherty et
al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Dougherty2000&#34;&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;). For instance, they stress that tensions
are created in through different themes: framing of knowledge (new)
links, tensions across product/business/strategy ventilating sense and
knowledge across all levels of the firm. Making decisions on innovation
would be a fallacy where people actually look for approval and rather
building sense interactively (Christiansen and Varnes

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Christiansen2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;). This viewpoint insists that innovation
management should create the means to support such interactionist action
to sustain learning mechanisms and handling novelty from exploration to
exploitation. In other words, the creation of meaning, the sense-making
and associated learning triggered by generative practices rely on a
certain &lt;strong&gt;ecology of generativity&lt;/strong&gt;. We derive the notion from the
ecology of creativity described in (Cohendet, Grandadam, and Simon

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Cohendet2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;; Harrington 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Harrington1990&#34;&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;) but
also the case of managing technical experts in science-based firms
revisiting the concept of epistemic communities by creating diversity
(proto-epistemic societies) in (Cabanes 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Cabanes2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In (Stigliani and Ravasi 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Stigliani2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;), they refer to
&lt;em&gt;prospective models of sensemaking&lt;/em&gt; driven by design thinking practice
(Continuum agency) but unfortunately it considers only the design
process without calling for the generativity for the client or the
designed object for end-users. We can actually question the usefulness
as the CEO of Continuum stated in (Lockwood 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lockwood2010&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;,
20):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q:I would think that afterward they might fall back to their more
analytical thought processes. A: Oh, that’s absolutely true. But it’s
progress, even if it’s like taking two steps forward and one step
back. In some cases, they may even have a natural tendency toward
design thinking, but it has been sup- pressed because of the way
things are traditionally done in corporations. Q:I wonder if there is
any concrete way to evaluate the prevalence of design thinking or
design as a competitive strategy in to- day’s organizations. Do you
have any recommendations for how we might assess this? A:That’s a
great question. I don’t know how you would measure it, though. You
know, that’s kind of the essence of the value of design thinking: You
start to value things you just can’t measure. If you try to measure
what you can’t measure&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, generative processes rely on several practices, heuristics
and learning mechanisms that include a social dimension to create
meaning, make sense, that could perhaps in the end lead to decisions
once interest and beliefs are settled. A sister approach is also
addressed with the sensemaking perspective in a crisis mode (Berthod and
Müller-seitz 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Berthod2016a&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;) with the notion of managing the
unexpected (Weick 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Weick2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;) and highly-resilient
organizations (Sutcliffe and Christianson 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Sutcliffe2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;).
But it is unfortunately a case for high uncertainty and extreme level of
adaptiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we have seen that there are ways of explaining how the unknown
could be used as a driver to create meaning and gradually make sense of
the novelty. Totem, metaphors, desirable futures can used to organize
innovation. But still, by being &amp;ldquo;pre-decision&amp;rdquo; it avoids the
decision-making and some behavioural dimensions of exploitation.
Inversely, if were to follow this interactionist perspective we struggle
to identify the handles to manage exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the useful, necessary articulations and interdependencies to
work on? Should we only rely on generating &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; and hope that some
will go through this ecology of generativity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This probe onto decision-making for innovation, playing on the balance
and performance of exploration and exploitation tends to reinforce the
dichotomy between the two. It shows from the organizational adaptation
and learning perspective that generative processes can occur &lt;em&gt;upstream&lt;/em&gt;
or in a distributed way. In any case, they emphasize the antagonistic
effects of exploration and exploitation. The modes of collective action
can take different shapes (linear and/or interactive), but still rely on
managerial personae to separate and balance both regimes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-conclusion-limiting-assumptions-on-the-extension-of-generative-processes&#34;&gt;Chapter conclusion: limiting assumptions on the extension of generative processes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this first chapter of literature review, we started with the seminal
adaptive model (James G March &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;) that was largely
extended in the literature of organizational ambidexterity. As the model
is now reaching out for innovation management with the tensions of
exploration and exploitation, we proposed to discuss this initial
setting with management of the unknown. Several writings indicate that
the constructs of exploration, exploitation and ambidexterity require
clearer definition and understanding to prescribe practices due to the
nuances brought by impact of the chosen unit of analysis (individual,
social, organizational and system) as well as contingent factors. This
ambiguous stretch is due to the gap created by models, derived from
problem-solving, currently applied to new contexts and knowledge drive
by innovation and the unknown. Is it still conceivable to separate
exploration from exploitation in the unknown?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the behavioural roots of this work, we got to the point of
discussing the literature on decision-making with respect to the unknown
that is addressed by the evolution, emphasis and drift of the construct
of exploration. Reaching out for innovation reconsiders the search-based
model of adaptive processes, so that exploration is no longer just a
regime ensuring that the system is adapted enough to the unbounded
problem at stake. Indeed, novel alternatives and consequences are
generated dynamically expanding the problem domain with unknown
probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then focused our attention on the generative phenomenon that supports
this problem shift, expansion and potential reconfiguration. Theories,
tools, methods and practices exist to support such phenomenon. Most of
them could be labelled under the Design umbrella, but also many other
are more &lt;em&gt;silent&lt;/em&gt;. Generative processes take place in an ubiquitous
fashion when compared to rational models supporting exploitation. The
emergent nature of novelty, preceding problem formulation and solving,
and making decisions, pushed our reasoning down the lines of
interactionist and network perspectives supporting the creation of
meaning and collective sense-making. These approaches are definitely
complementary and fill the gaps left by a pure decision-making in firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relying on a rather linear perspective of innovation through
&lt;strong&gt;adaption&lt;/strong&gt; could be a first approach to organize generative processes
for exploration and balancing out exploitation for learning and
adaptation. The organization learns and adapts from generated mutations
in the Known or Unknown[^8]. The edge between what is known and unknown
challenges the nature of the non-mutual conditioning between exploration
and exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It encourages the training of leaders to develop their ambidextrous
thinking and manage their teams accordingly. The second approach sees
innovation in a more networking perspective through &lt;strong&gt;interactions&lt;/strong&gt;. It
would promote the design of spaces, networks and interactions means by
management executives. This in-between perspective gives more room to
the generative phenomenon so that they could then support an ecology of
generativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could argue for non-interventionist management, but we made the
assumption that we would steer the &lt;em&gt;performance of the generative
process&lt;/em&gt;: fluency and defixation, and the organizational impact and
sustain. The first criteria is more related to the standalone practice
reduced to the individual or the design team, whereas the second calls
for the diffusion, learning and regeneration of the organization subject
to the generative phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last, we have taken a micro and then a macro perspective to
sustaining organizational learning and adaptation through ambidexterity
and innovation. We have elucidated the thought process of the individual
(decision and design) and its organization in a broader sense. The
interactionist view describes also the social dimension. If we use again
the biological metaphor, one the axioms of ecology is that the success
of a unit is measured by the number of descendants. Transposed to our
generativity, we can question what the unit means for generative
phenomena as they can localized and linearized (design department,
exploration-dedicated unit), or be distributed (we are all designers!).
We could then envision a generated concept (a prototype, a product, a
technology, a function etc.) or consider a colony of generated concepts
that have something in common and for which individual sacrifice is the
norm (portfolio, program, product line etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe then that in a firm context, there are also other action
means to sustain generativity and an efficient interaction with
exploration and exploitation. We propose then to look at other ways of
managing the unknown mainly through project management. By doing so, we
can overcome the several limitations addressed in this chapter for
models of ambidexterity through adaptation, interactions and their
management. Projects, by encapsulating management activities, are indeed
a device that sometimes can be the equivalent to small firm, or business
unit, or sometimes just a piece in a larger puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure-thing principle: (Savage 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Savage1954&#34;&gt;1954&lt;/a&gt;, 21) &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We remind to the reader the language used in that time was of
course very different from what management studies has become now.
We may refer of course to the narration and analysis of innovation
management by (Burns and Stalker 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Burns1961&#34;&gt;1961&lt;/a&gt;) explaining
organic and mechanistic structure with a strong background from
sociology of organization applied to new product development. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, such pattern could be associated with the concept of
Agile management experimented and formalized in software development &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we refer here to subjective expected utility theories &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that in the cumulative prospect theory, the
original formulation violated the fundamental transitivity. They
managed accommodating the axiom by changing the integral measure
with weights and still allowing reversal as in Allais’ paradox and
other oddities &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:6&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author’s translation: &amp;ldquo;Schließlich sei noch auf folgende
interessante Analogie zwischen dem göttlichen Schöpfungsakt in der
Natur und dem menschlichen Schöpfungsakt in der Technick
hingewiesen. Im einen wie im anderen Falle entsteht von Zeit zu Zeit
unstetig, anscheinend ohne nachweisbare Beziehung zu
Vorangegangenen, etwas Neues. Wir nenen das eine: &amp;ldquo;biologische
Mutation&amp;rdquo; und verstehen darunter die Verwicklichung einer göttlichen
Idee, das andere: &amp;ldquo;technische Mutation&amp;rdquo; und meinen damit das
plötzliche Auftreten und die erste Verwicklichung einer menschlichen
Idee. Ebenso wie es eine der grossen Aufgaben der Biologie ist, das
Zustandekommen von Mutationen für ihren Bereich zu erforschen, so
muss es auch für uns zu den obersten Richtlinien zählen, die
Vorbedingungen für das Auftreten enuer Ideen zu ergründen.&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:7&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: we are in a position where action gains in importance and
leaves decision in the dark or at best as an ex-post social
representation (Laroche 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Laroche1995&#34;&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unitas multiplex: l’unité de, dans la diversité.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;La Méthode: La Nature de la nature&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Edgar Morin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous chapter we have exposed models of ambidexterity. We have
insisted on the role of ambidexterity and how it would rely of adaptive
and interactive processes. Both of these play with an agent-based and
socio-organizational views of the firm to sustain organizational
learning. They contribute to the balancing of exploration/exploitation
by offering room for generative processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generativity, an engine of innovation, will shift the performance
frontier of exploration and exploitation. The adaptation relies more on
the constructs of exploration/exploitation and a linear perspective of
innovation. Whereas, the interactionism brings a networking perspective
whilst stressing the emergent nature of generative processes through
creation of meaning and sensemaking. Both place a different emphasis on
decision-making organizing collective action in the firm. However, as we
stressed the invasive role of the unknown through innovation management,
the assumption of separating and balancing exploration vs. exploitation
may be shattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, we propose to tackle another action mode where the
unknown occupies a key place. It is less linear or distributed that the
previous models of ambidexterity. Seen from the firm level and system
level, it is &lt;strong&gt;encapsulated&lt;/strong&gt;. We will consider the literature on
project management through the lens of researchers who rethink project
management as practice reveals new challenges (Svejvig and Andersen

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Svejvig2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;) which also lead to critical management studies
(Cicmil and Hodgson 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Cicmil2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects are seen as appropriate devices to cope with turbulent
environments (Ekstedt et al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ekstedt1999&#34;&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;), they can also
stimulate learning and creativity to support complex products
development (Hobday 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hobday2000&#34;&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;), and the project-based
organization is regarded as efficient for information sharing and
knowledge management (Silver 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Silver2000&#34;&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;; DeFillippi

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-DeFillippi2001&#34;&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;). It is even more important to deal with the
notion of projects as they have been institutionalized extensively in
firms through the Project Management Institute and the Project
Management Book along with certification for practitioners. Overall, it
makes of project management a stimulating candidate to perform
ambidexterity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our concern is what happens when these projects and its management try
to shape the unknown, specially because it has this encapsulated mode of
dealing with exploitation and exploration. We are then more inclined at
looking at the adaptive mode of project management rather than
optimizing models for projects (Davies, Manning, and Söderlund

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Davies2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;). However, we still see how the fields of
innovation and project management could be cross fertilized at little
further at the light of generative processes and managing the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;

    The &lt;a href=&#34;#exploration-project-management-radical-innovation-and-corporate-entrepreneurship&#34; title=&#34;Exploration project management, radical innovation and corporate entrepreneurship&#34;&gt;first section&lt;/a&gt; will cover the literature on exploration project
management, then we will look of the organization design of projects (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/#project-based-organization-supporting-ambidexterity&#34; title=&#34;Project-based organization support ambidexterity&#34;&gt;section 2&lt;/a&gt;) and finally we will have a close look at change project management and
strategic project management that is heavily contingent to environment
perception (&lt;a href=&#34;#change-project-and-the-environment&#34; title=&#34;Change project and the environment&#34;&gt;section 3&lt;/a&gt;).
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;exploration-project-management-radical-innovation-and-corporate-entrepreneurship&#34;&gt;Exploration project management, radical innovation and corporate entrepreneurship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is largely established that institutionalized project management
comes with a certain faith in instrumental rationality, objectivity,
reductionism and expectations of universal validity (Ika and Hodgson

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ika2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;; Cicmil and Hodgson 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Cicmil2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, 1182).
Traditional projects are framed, needs and requirements are captured
into objectives allowing to breakdown the project into work packages and
tasks. Usually, these are mirrored by an organization (&lt;em&gt;work breakdown
organization&lt;/em&gt;). Gates track the progress against criteria agreed upon
from the beginning or by mimicry in-between them. The strongest
assumption is that the course of action is driven by risk management
(risk registers) and uncertainty reduction towards the objective. Change
control boards are used to deal with several uncertainties or additional
demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, most of choices and states of nature are known and usually
uncertain. It is largely the case of (new) product development process.
Several fallacies are known already (Thomke and Reinertsen

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Thomke2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;) revealing some of the dangerous rational myths
behind project management (Boxenbaum and Jonsson

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Boxenbaum2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;). Of course, several add-ons were made to the
traditional project management methodology (waterfall model): scrum and
agility (Takeuchi and Nonaka 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Takeuchi1986&#34;&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;) or diamond
approach to deal with contingency, novelty and complexity (Shenhar and
Dvir 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Shenhar2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;). As several schools of thoughts
(Söderlund 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Soderlund2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;) can be found in project
management, we propose to focus our discussion on the tension with
innovation management. We will tend to fit with this line of thought as
it considers the association of strategic management with the launch of
exploration project by firms. In other words, it contributes to firm’s
survival and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding articles and books that openly discuss the place of the unknown
in management is a complicated task. There are very few publications on
the topic, usually the word has a secondary position leaving on the
front seat other keywords such as innovation, radical innovation,
entrepreneurship or simply high uncertainty or at best unforeseeable
uncertainty. We will leave aside the notion such as unexpected or
surprise as we are concerned by the deliberate action of heading into
the unknown for a desirable future. In (Svejvig and Andersen

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Svejvig2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;), we would fit in the category of &lt;em&gt;Complexity
and Uncertainty&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Broader Conceptualization&lt;/em&gt;, which necessarily
echoes the contingency, behavioural and decision schools of thought as
we have been developing an interest for neighbouring research
discipline: innovation management. As explained in a recent and critical
literature review (Davies, Manning, and Söderlund

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Davies2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;), these two disciplines have evolved over
decades and they explain why/how these two have failed to learn from
each other. We propose to follow this path and bring additional light to
these teachings with the question of managing the unknown through
project management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    In this first subsection, we will address the issue of project
management facing high uncertainty or dealing with the unknown. We will
then characterize the features of such management with respect to the
host organization and finally how it deals with generative processes.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;exploration-project-organizational-oddity&#34;&gt;Exploration project: organizational oddity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated previously, we are interested in discussing at the edge of
project management and innovation research: exploration project (Lenfle

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lenfle2008&#34;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;). They differ and destabilize the optimizing
model of traditional &lt;em&gt;plan and execute&lt;/em&gt; that one could see in
development processes. It cannot also be reduced to an adaptive model as
presented in the previous chapter. It embeds features that call for
proactivity. Several principles are defined to support his new project
category:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to set up a specific entity to manage the exploration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on the central role of tests (prototypes, testing,
customer trials, etc.) in the management process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on the need for concurrent exploration which must
concern both concepts and knowledge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The management process must take into account these two different
dimensions of performance: the value of the products and accumulated
knowledge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The management tools used must allow a reformulation of the
objectives along the way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, some features are derived from adaptive models inspired
by contingency theory (Shenhar and Dvir 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Shenhar2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;) but it
brings insight from innovation management that call for a mode of action
continuously shifting (Brown and Eisenhardt 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Brown1997&#34;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;). It
also relies on innovative design practices (Hatchuel et al.

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hatchuel2010&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;; Le Masson, Weil, and Hatchuel

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeMasson2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeMasson2010&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;). By developing
this experiential approach (Eisenhardt and Tabrizi

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Eisenhardt1995&#34;&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;) and based on the works of (Loch, Meyer, and
Pich 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Loch2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;), the exploration strategy consists in
multiplying probe and learn steps, the projects outcomes are hard to
grasp as the action mode challenges heavily optimization and adaptive
model. Trial and error can be complemented by selectionism. Careful
balance of these two strategies may contribute to overall performance
depending on complexity and unforeseeable uncertainty (Sommer and Loch

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Sommer2004&#34;&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distancing of the projects can be seen as an organization oddity
(Lenfle 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lenfle2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;). The author proposed that with the
support of design theories and design management, the concurrent
exploration of knowledge and concepts could help support the project
variables: objectives, risks, capabilities to be developed. Projects are
indeed very stimulating loci where technology and system meet knowledge
management (Silver 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Silver2000&#34;&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;) thus bearing critical
capabilities for the firm. As these are used as experiments in its
broadest sense (Thomke 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Thomke2003&#34;&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;), they can also absorb
shocks and risks that a traditional new product development process
wouldn’t (Brown and Eisenhardt 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Brown1997&#34;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;). Yet, the
strangeness of the project requires careful management of the unknown
dimensions of the project: e.g. potential organizational ties through
communities contingent to the expansion made into the unknown.&lt;br&gt;
In the field of innovation management, we could not avoid the works of
Gina O’Connor (O’Connor 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-OConnor2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. First of all, in
this literature, projects are seen as devices for innovation, and they
usually are synonymous with product development. Using them as unit of
analysis, project timelines are made to articulate the link with
breakthrough innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploration is the centre of attention, and emphasis is put on the
actual creation process (path creation, regenerative dynamic
capabilities (Ambrosini, Bowman, and Collier

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ambrosini2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;)). As for the previously quoted works and
others (Maniak, Midler, and Lenfle 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Maniak2007a&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;; Beaume,
Maniak, and Midler 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Beaume2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;), the organizational ties are
not discussed in much depth despite the strategic dimension of these
projects heavily challenging functions of existing products (concepts
and knowledge). For example, the rich longitudinal studies (O’Connor

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-OConnor2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;) show how the projects are hosted by several
business units or departments, and sometimes, end up establishing a
proper entity on its own. To counter ad-hoc behaviours, she calls then,
beyond the necessary support of top management during the exploration
process, for a proper institutionalisation thus avoiding only relying on
innovation champions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exploration project may have the tendency to float across organizations
as they encapsulate several innovative practices challenging
exploitation. They bring new experiences, they engage in action, which
potentially allows pushing the performance frontier of exploration. It
does contribute to ambidexterity with antagonistic effects for
exploitation certainties: evaluation of objectives, contributing teams
and resources and established knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before coming back to the organizational and institutional issue, we
would like to focus on the mechanisms that potential regenerative
dynamic capabilities should address as the exploration projects glide
across an organization in the hope for a landing field so they can
actually plan the plan and execute the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;difficulty-of-transitioning&#34;&gt;Difficulty of transitioning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contingency stressed in the work of Sylvain Lenfle and Christoph
Loch can be confirmed through several other works presented in a special
issue (Midler, Killen, and Kock 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Midler2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;). It reinforces
the perspective that traditional optimizing models are insufficient for
innovation (Davies, Manning, and Söderlund 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Davies2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;).
Contextuality is necessary to understand the complexities, the successes
and the failures of projects. For instance in (Akkermans and Oorschot

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Akkermans2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;), they explain how small feedback loops
between project phases and concurrency (Maniak et al.

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Maniak2008&#34;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;) can reduce risks and delays. The importance of
coordination is also stressed in the alleged decision gate in product
development (Christiansen and Varnes 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Christiansen2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;)
where stakeholders are rather networking instead of making decisions.&lt;br&gt;
However, numerous practices and myopic behaviours can be found like in
the case of mega projects. Their fragility (Ansar et al.

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ansar2016&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;) show the absence of learning on the methods and
tools used to conduct such large projects. Stage-gate mode also tend to
fail quite too often when following the iron triangle of Quality Cost
and Delay of standard project management (Sethi and Iqbal

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Sethi2008&#34;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;). This encourages to rethink constantly what
makes the performance of the project, the evaluation criteria used along
the trajectory as it was stressed in (Lenfle 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lenfle2008&#34;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;,

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lenfle2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;). The same authors also through a tremendous
historical effort on project management insisted that originally the
root of project management (Lenfle and Loch 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lenfle2010&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;,

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lenfle2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;) where closer to innovation management as also
stressed by (Davies, Manning, and Söderlund 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Davies2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;). So
the notion of failure against an optimizing framework, which is also the
exploitative regime discussed in the previous chapter, encourage the
re-articulation of the performance for exploration projects (Elmquist
and Le Masson 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Elmquist2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
As the innovation management research has (mainly) developed the
adaptive model with respect to project management, the over-emphasis on
these models had a tendency of not considering enough optimizing
&amp;ldquo;constraints&amp;rdquo; such as planning, execution and exploitation.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is
then key to understand how the contingency is managed but also how this
distance is engineered within projects and by stakeholders or the
projects’ governance.&lt;br&gt;
Several hints can be found in the literature such as: sensemaking of
risky and loss of control (Iacovou and Dexter 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Iacovou2004&#34;&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;),
terminating projects (Green, Welsh, and Dehler 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Green2003&#34;&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;),
modelling with real options theory (Lint and Pennings

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lint2001&#34;&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;), also mapping risk-tolerance (Kwak and LaPlace

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Kwak2005&#34;&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;) and escalating commitment relative to the project
(Ross and Staw 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ross1993&#34;&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt;). The encapsulated model of
managing the unknown and dealing with risks and uncertainty, as a
vehicle for innovation, continuously defy the working reference for the
host firm. As the practice shows, shifts are made and references are
made against the original concepts as shown in (Seidel

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Seidel2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;) across multiple contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For an exploration project to find a landing spot we see the constant
performance re-evaluation challenges and stress test against
exploitation constraints. The problem can also be turned upside down by
ensuring the existence of large net to catch the exploration effort and
make sense of it. They may have learning and adaptive mechanisms
differing the rest of the organization (Lundin and Midler
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lundin1998&#34;&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;), or expecting to have a full projet-based
organization. So, what are then the underlying mechanisms that drive
expansions in project’s scope? Is there a way directing it and
control/measure a &lt;em&gt;distance&lt;/em&gt; with respect to exploitation ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are very &lt;em&gt;engineering-oriented&lt;/em&gt; questions but we force these
questions as it has been stressed that the models of ambidexterity have
enforced the non-mutual conditioning between exploration and
exploitation. So coming from the project management perspective, and its
encapsulation mode, we propose to study if ambidexterity is discussed
differently given evolutions of innovation management.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;generative-processes-in-project-management&#34;&gt;Generative processes in project management?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are focused on innovation management and project management as
they contribute to separation of exploration and exploitation, we
propose to discuss the underlying mechanisms driving the exploration
effort: mainly generative processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design theories and design management have been solicited by researchers
already (Lenfle 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lenfle2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;) for instance, and (O’Connor

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-OConnor2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;) refers to the management concept of
&amp;ldquo;regenerative&amp;rdquo; dynamic capabilities developed by (Ambrosini, Bowman, and
Collier 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ambrosini2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;). In the behavioural school
(Söderlund 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Soderlund2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;), the place of creativity is
discussed in several contributions, but still remains secondary compared
to other aspects of project management. Our focus is not specially on
notions such as creative climate, even though it may contribute
positively to the project conduct, specially compared to tools and
frameworks induced by management theories aiming at reducing variation
(Ekvall 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ekvall1993&#34;&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ekvall2000&#34;&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;). We are rather
interested on the actual creative process and methods that we tasked to
label in its weaker form: generativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In (Harrison and Rouse 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Harrison2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;), feedback sessions in
creative projects (industrial design and modern dance) reveal several
moves used by designers and feedback providers. The feedback provided
two kind of signals: &lt;em&gt;excavations&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;adjustments&lt;/em&gt;. It thus fed an
adaptive mode for designers to bring back previous concepts and
refinements to the prototypes. Such approach calls for a deeper value
management in the spirit of what was discussed in the previous chapter
on how to formalize design practices. For instance, (Gillier, Hooge, and
Piat 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Gillier2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;) manage the value exploration and measure
the &amp;ldquo;distance&amp;rdquo; of the concept shift and novel knowledge (Seidel

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Seidel2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;). In the same vein, cases of exploration project
management show how to build legitimacy around novelty with stakeholders
(Hooge and Dalmasso 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hooge2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;) and management value
creation and value realization (R. Maniak et al.

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Maniak2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;). Design Thinking was proposed to be blended
with project management to enhance value and change management (Ben
Mahmoud-Jouini, Midler, and Silberzahn

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-BenMahmoud-Jouini2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;). All of these approaches bring
additional depth to the interactive model and extending the project’s
requirement for greater quality. Within the project team (Holmquist

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Holmquist2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;), an evaluator can play the role to channel
continuously the project evaluation criteria and bring a systematic
reflection which acts as &lt;em&gt;catalyst&lt;/em&gt; for transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly to ambidexterity literature, the role creative leadership in
project management is identified as a way to manage generative processes
and its challenges for exploration. (Bech 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Bech2001&#34;&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;)
stresses the proximity of project management and project leadership,
which can facilitate employee creativity, support the emergence of the
leader’s vision and organize collective creativity (Mainemelis, Kark,
and Epitropaki 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Mainemelis2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;). Recent works also have put
the emphasis on the different leadership figures (Ezzat, Le Masson, and
Weil 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ezzat2017a&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;) including traditional ones such as the
visionary and the animator, but brings a novel perspective with the
&lt;em&gt;defixator&lt;/em&gt; role. The leader brings the practice of defixation (Ezzat et
al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ezzat2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;) to creative team management with minimal
executive feedback so that team members can generate concepts avoiding
fixation effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generative processes in project management as shown here tend to
constantly orchestrate value of novelty by circulating concepts and
meaning, or by comparison with some reference point. High constraints
and pressure in the iron triangle can also be a trigger for creativity
to reach such objectives or stretch goals (Maier and Branzei

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Maier2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;). But others have also put forward the violation
of project management rules (Mangematin et al.

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Mangematin2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;) as a means to support learning. Hacking can
be then encouraged to mitigate more efficiently risks associated with
delay and uncertainties as common project rules tend to increase risks
(Olin and Wickenberg 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Olin2001&#34;&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;). Rule bending and
redefinition can be adjusted not only to generate better course of
action sustaining project’s (dynamic) performance and also exploration
guided by systematic rule breaking such as &lt;em&gt;skunkworks&lt;/em&gt; (Bommer,
DeLaPorte, and Higgins 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Bommer2002&#34;&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such generative processes are referred as non-routine work in the
framework of organizational routines (Obstfeld

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Obstfeld2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;). An echo of the &lt;em&gt;silent designers&lt;/em&gt; introduced
by Angela Dumas and Henry Mintzberg. A creative project is defined in
such context as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An emergent trajectory of interdependent action initiated and
orchestrated by multiple actors to introduce change into a social
context&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;If organizational routines are viewed as trajectories of
interdependent action through which organizations generally get things
done, then creative projects are the means by which they get new
things started&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Placing the generation of routines into creative projects allows
D.Obstfeld to reconsider the interaction with adaptive model introduced
by James March through the &lt;em&gt;garbage can model&lt;/em&gt;. He shows the extension
of the adaptive model where informal choices brought by creative
projects differing from the search of organizational routine. Whilst
keeping the idea to economize cognitive effort, one can rethink the
theorization of interdependent action including organizational routines
and generative processes. One can do so by stressing the emergence of
novel choices (not found by search) but through creative effort:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This expanded consideration of combinatorial elements underscores the
importance of knowledge articulation as a means for linking problems
to solutions, people to ideas (i.e., either problems or solutions),
and enlisting people to participate in unfolding action trajectories&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the figure below
(&lt;a href=&#34;#fig:obstfeldroutines&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;fig:obstfeldroutines&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;),
the impact of the interdependent action is represented and insists on
the nature of the direction of such non-routine work (stable,
incremental, radical and architectural):&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research on the middle-ground present cases of how such routines emerge
and creative projects contribute to it. It reveals the different roles
endorsed by the project manager: sense-maker, game master, web-weaver,
and flow-balancer (Simon 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Simon2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;). Later research
conducted in the game industry also demonstrated how a creative project,
in corporate entrepreneurship perspective, is managed to recombine
routines and rethink the new product development process across the firm
in addition to deliver a novel product radically changing the
traditional identity of the games developed (Cohendet and Simon

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Cohendet2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of the leader is also emphasized in (Adler and Obstfeld

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Adler2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;) with a channelling effort on the project team by
bringing additional insight on the direction of &lt;em&gt;creative search&lt;/em&gt;
supporting exploration. By revising Dewey’s philosophy, the importance
of impulse (affect) in addition to intelligence and habit drivers,
allows placing their respective impact on project, deliberation and
routine levels (see
Fig.&lt;a href=&#34;#fig:adlerdewey&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;fig:adlerdewey&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed analytical lens allows thinking what is to be managed and
the nature of the articulation of the generative processes in project
management and the interdependence with organizational routines for
instance. Despite having a different background, we cannot avoid
discussing the works of Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka, with the
use of ambiguity and metaphors (Dumas 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Dumas1994&#34;&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;) to build
and drive project teams (also referred as knowledge teams); e.g. &amp;ldquo;Tall
Boy&amp;rdquo; for the Honda Civic and &amp;ldquo;Rugby Player in a Dinner suit&amp;rdquo; for the
Honda Accord (Nonaka 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Nonaka1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;; Clark and Fujimoto

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Clark1990&#34;&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;). Whilst developing the knowledge management and
learning, later works of I.Nonaka have introduced the management concept
&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;ba&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; (literally meaning &amp;ldquo;place&amp;rdquo;, not necessarily physical):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What differentiates &lt;span class=&#34;underline&#34;&gt;ba&lt;/span&gt; from ordinary
human interaction is the concept of knowledge creation. &lt;span
class=&#34;underline&#34;&gt;Ba&lt;/span&gt; provides a platform for advancing
individual and/or collective knowledge. It is from such a platform
that a transcendental perspective integrates all information needed&lt;/em&gt;
(Nonaka and Konno 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Nonaka1998&#34;&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By developing an interactive approach to learning, socialization,
externalization, combination and internalization of processes (SECI
model), it helps describing what contributes to the dynamics of
knowledge management enact the common place of &lt;em&gt;ba&lt;/em&gt;. In (Krogh, Ichijo,
and Nonaka 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-VonKrogh2000&#34;&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;), numerous qualitative studies
support this view enabling knowledge through creation of rich context,
building communities and supporting knowledge exchange. They insist on
numerous pitfalls such as a too strong focus on generating knowledge,
thus accentuating the articulation, interdependence and circulation of
knowledge rather than on quantity. It opposes to the view on the
generation of alternatives in J.March’s model discussed in the previous
chapter (March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such perspective is further developed in the managing flow and
introducing also an ancient Greek concept of wisdom &lt;em&gt;phronesis&lt;/em&gt;
insisting on the virtue of thinking of the context and judging value.
These processes sustain in their view creative dynamic capabilities by
opposition to adaptive ones at a meso-level (Nonaka, Hirose, and Takeda

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Nonaka2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;). Their demonstration and conceptualization goes
further in order to propose the image of a fractal organization as a
reflection of these knowledge dynamics supporting creative dynamic
capabilities (Nonaka et al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Nonaka2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;), as multiple
&amp;ldquo;edges&amp;rdquo; are managed on multiple direction. Relying on the fractal idea,
raises the question of the pattern to be repeated to support. What is
the actual action logics driving this dynamic capability?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we have covered how the encapsulation of generative processes
in projects contribute to adaptive or interactive models at the project
level and with stakeholders. However, the organizational dimensions are
not addressed specially in the spirit of organizational ambidexterity,
despite still considering the separation of exploration and exploitation
but with some modulations (e.g. hacking).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative projects have a temporary nature (Bakker et al.
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Bakker2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;) imposing time frames over the project teams and
stakeholders determining tasks and team processes. After having
illustrated the nature of generative mechanisms in exploration and/or
exploration project management as a means to substantiate innovation
management, we must clarify the organizational ties supporting such
trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point of the literature review, it is important to note that
these ties were not as present with meta perspectives of the adaptive
model and the interactive model, since projects are used as experiments
for the whole firm, as an ambidextrous offshoot in an organization that
should be preserved for exploitation performance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-based-organization-supporting-ambidexterity&#34;&gt;Project-based organization supporting ambidexterity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous section, we extensively discussed the nature of
exploration project management and its engines such as creativity,
generative processes, non-routine work, rule bending, but also their
limitations and difficulties to loop back to an exploitation regime. The
key feature of the exploitation of exploration project requires a
continuous management of performance and valuation as the project
battles through the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In innovation management literature, along with the strong contingency
theoretical background that could be traced back to (Burns and Stalker

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Burns1961&#34;&gt;1961&lt;/a&gt;), the notion of organic structure supporting
innovation in new product development led to the conceptualization of
the matrix organization where projects and product developments can pool
resources sustained by departments and units (Galbraith

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Galbraith1971&#34;&gt;1971&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Galbraith2010&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;). It is the
preferred mode to &lt;em&gt;integrate cross-functional resources and knowledge to
cope with high uncertainty, complexity and change&lt;/em&gt; (Davies, Manning, and
Söderlund 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Davies2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;). These notions blended to the point
where projects became fully associated with the concept of organic and
flexible ways of organizing. Originally, in the detail of the Tom Burns
and Georges Stalker, the organic structure was defined based on one case
study and by contrast with the mechanistic cases (Hannan and Freeman

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hannan1989&#34;&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is instructive to note that Burns and Stalker found only one
instance of an organic structure in a situation in which this should
have been the appropriate form of organization. Their book is
essentially an analysis of why organization that ought (sic) to change
to organic systems fail to do so, even when there is high agreement
among their managers that they should move in that direction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advice given by T.Burns and G.Stalker should be treated carefully.
On the other side, the matrix organization has more cases to support the
interaction between the functional structure and projects. In (Galbraith

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Galbraith1971&#34;&gt;1971&lt;/a&gt;), the transition from a functional form to
the other is detailed also with the transitioning with a task force to
cope with delays, and contingent factors are highlighted encouraging a
form or the other. The level of complexity and reconfigurability can be
increased to such height calling for careful management of careers,
opportunities and reconfigurable decision forums in addition to
satisfying changing client demands across the globe or just in identity
and customization (Galbraith 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Galbraith2010&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;). We also point
out the fact that the change is conducted in a dissociate way to the
actual organizational life, i.e. as for organization design for
ambidexterity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is then crucial for exploration project and generative processes to
understand how efficient matrix organizations are to support these
projects but also sustain innovation and regenerative dynamic
capabilities of such organization. As we have shown, the leadership
figure was rather present, putting a lot of weight of its shoulders and
probably requiring training and management tools that still require to
be elucidated as revealed in the first chapter on paradox management.&lt;br&gt;
Here, we would like to discuss the organization design and studies
domains required to support the project management we are interested in.
The research community organized around journals such as the &lt;em&gt;Project
Management Journal&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;International Journal of Project Management&lt;/em&gt;
have released numerous articles around the project-based management with
Rodney Turner’s lifework (Turner 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Turner2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;), but also with
a special issue (Söderlund and Müller 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Soderlund2014a&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;) in
PMJ, another in IJPM (Söderlund, Hobbs, and Ahola

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Soderlund2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;) and also two in Organizational Studies
(Sydow, Lindkvist, and Defillippi 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Sydow2004&#34;&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;; Bakker et al.

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Bakker2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;). They raise several challenges around
theoretical model, methodologies including a lack of practice-based
research to enhance theoretical models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Firstly, we will discuss the organizational ties of exploration projects
compared to the host firm. The mirroring hypothesis between engineering
design rules and organization design will give us some ground to
understand where generative processes are rooted and the necessary
renewal for exploration projects. Secondly, we will naturally address
the topic of ad-hoc patterns, as exploration may lead to weighing the
anchor. Finally, we will deal with the concept of portfolio and program
management for exploration.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mirroring-hypothesis-and-renewal-of-resources-and-competencies&#34;&gt;Mirroring hypothesis and renewal of resources and competencies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a matrix organization where projects are kicked off and requiring
resources in functional departments, exploration projects will request
competencies that may be off the charts. As a reference point, one can
imagine that the firm has settled its engineering for product
development and that it may even have developed modular engineering for
improved efficiency (MacCormack, Baldwin, and Rusnak

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-MacCormack2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;). The mirroring hypothesis tested in (Colfer
and Baldwin 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Colfer2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;) shows the congruence between
product architecture and organization. It also reveals the interest in
having a partial mirroring or the capacity of breaking the mirror for
strategic competitive advantage. In a normative perspective (Colfer and
Baldwin 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Colfer2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;, 716) they advise that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The designers of technical systems are boundedly rational—they cannot
know or do everything. Thus, organizations are needed to carry out
complex design and production processes. For system architects and
organization designers, the design challenge is to create a technical
architecture and corresponding organization that together are capable
of carrying out complex tasks and solving problems that may come up
along the way&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The static view is of course enlightening, but mirroring dynamics are
not explicit. In the weakest form, they present the mirroring trap, i.e.
the failure of supporting ambidexterity, which can be countered by
partial mirroring where knowledge boundaries are broader than
operational task ones. It brings some slack to the alternatives and
interdependencies in product architecture, yet there is a risk of
‘early’ modularization causing failures because of lack of system
understanding. Due to the complexity and high rate of change, the system
knowledge will be necessarily incomplete, so they recommend (Colfer and
Baldwin 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Colfer2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;, 724):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In such cases, organizational processes that deviate from strict
mirroring are likely to be beneficial in terms of technical
performance, competitive advantage, and the accumulation of valuable
knowledge and capabilities. A “partial mirroring” strategy can be an
effective way to explore and understand latent interdependencies that
are not apparent under the current technical architecture.
Furthermore, if the stakes are sufficiently high, firms may go
further, overturning the current architecture for their own strategic
advantage. Strategic mirror-breaking, if successful, can bring about
wholesale changes to industry structure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploration projects will tend to play in partial mirroring organization
where latent interdependencies may be challenged. It would imply
technical and engineering issues, at a modular or even call for
architectural innovation (Henderson and Clark

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Henderson1990&#34;&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;). The temporary organization supporting the
project may be then in conflict with the established mirroring
organizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a very recent detailed literature review, Maxim Miterev, Rodney
Turner and colleagues bring the link with the organization design and
project-based organization. For instance, in (Miterev, Engwall, and
Jerbrant 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Miterev2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;) they warn us (through practice-based
research) on threats of isomorphism mechanisms (mimicry, coercion and
normative) against temporary-organization supporting one-off projects
dealing with high uncertainty (see below
Fig.&lt;a href=&#34;#fig:miterevisomorph&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;fig:miterevisomorph&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-isomorphic-pressures-on-project-based-organization-miterev-engwall-and-jerbrant-2017ref-miterev2017&#34;&gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/img/miterevisomorph.png&#34; data-caption=&#34;Isomorphic pressures on project-based organization (Miterev, Engwall, and Jerbrant 2017)&#34;&gt;


  &lt;img src=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/img/miterevisomorph.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  &gt;
&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; class=&#34;numbered&#34;&gt;
    Isomorphic pressures on project-based organization (Miterev, Engwall, and Jerbrant &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Miterev2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;)
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal rationality of such organization is then questioned specially
in a context of inter-relatedness of temporal organization with a
host/established functional organization in addition to institutional
fields. They advocate that isomorphic pressures may vary depending on
industrial sectors but that &lt;em&gt;skunkworks&lt;/em&gt; projects may be required to
escape such pressures of project-based organization. Institutional
entrepreneurship is seen as an another perspective to further understand
how novel practices countering pressures can be institutionalized in
firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the idea of extreme forces of reconfigurability (Galbraith

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Galbraith2010&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;), the project-based organization identified
as a proper organization form calls for a renewal of organization design
as discussed in (Miterev, Turner, and Mancini

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Miterev2017b&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;). It resurfaces the contingency of numerous
managerial phenomena and the links with wider unit of analysis in
organization studies and design. In a rationally bounded perspective,
(Simon 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Simon1967&#34;&gt;1967&lt;/a&gt;) gave his definition of organization
design with the adaptive model associated to decision-making and
information processing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Organizational design] is to investigate the information flows
that are essential for accomplishing the organization’s objectives,
then examine what these information patterns imply for organization
structure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the issue is that introducing adaptive, interactive, and
generative processes that may be encapsulated or not, should be
translated into design rules given a rational goal (Burton and Obel

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Burton2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;). The matrix form compared to the unitary one
was a way to deal with adaptation. It could lead, depending on places
and flow, to support exploration-related interactions. Can
organizational rules be generative? Are there design rules unlocking
interdependencies? Can the temporary organization support organizational
generativity?&lt;br&gt;
In (Van de Ven, Ganco, and Hinings 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-VandeVen2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, 396), the
authors trace the evolution of organization design evolving from
&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;contingency to configuration, to complementarity, and to complexity
and creative theories of organizing&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. The question of organizational
fit is then treated with whole new perspective: &lt;em&gt;generative fit&lt;/em&gt; (Avital
and Te’eni 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Avital2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;). The suggested rules for generative
designs should be evocative, open-ended and adaptive. It is worth
mentioning that their notion of adaptation embeds the concept of
re-invention which goes beyond the notion we have chosen stemming from
J.March’s view&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Quoting (Barry 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Barry2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;, 9), Andrew
Van de Ven, in the spirit of managing as design (Boland and Collopy

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Boland2004&#34;&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;) and thinking of organizations as design (Romme

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Romme2003&#34;&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;), proposes to follow up the emergent role of
professional designers, or architects as they blend several disciplines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;perhaps a more unified organization design school will emerge, where
“delight, deliver, and deepen” all come together using bits and pieces
from both orientations. To be successful thought, this new OD
[organization design] will require a lot more than asking executives
to brainstorm, prototype, and otherwise “get creative”. Coming up with
effective organization designs that deliver, delight, and deepen will
require training along the lines that designers get years of learning
how to reframe organizational problems into evocative questions,
finding inspirational networks alongside solutional ones, creative and
aesthetically sophisticated experimentation, and working with multiple
mediums and representational forms. It will also require systematic
testing over time, to see where and how these innovative designs work,
and don’t work. Clearly OD is heading towards a new chapter, perhaps
its most interesting and inventive one yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being an open invitation for future research, the hints given to
support such generative design rules for the organization remains quite
unclear and again bring back contingency theories to front seat with
numerous interactions (Van de Ven, Ganco, and Hinings

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-VandeVen2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;). Such contextuality is confirmed in (Turner,
Maylor, and Swart 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Turner2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;) bringing an analysis of
project management with organization ambidexterity literature stressing
the dynamics between human, social and organizational capital. Or even
with (Winch 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Winch2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;) proposing three domains of project
organizing: project-based firms, projects/programs, and
owners/operators. Their interactions stress the interfaces of
governance, resources and commercial domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When considering exploration project management, or at least, management
contributions integrating complexity and contingency theory (Shenhar and
Dvir 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Shenhar2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;), it is worth pointing out the managerial
implications are very short on what should be done regarding the
structural and social dimension of project-based management. At best,
(Asquin, Garel, and Picq 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Asquin2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;) identifies the risk of
loosing knowledge and competencies in project-based organization because
of lack of expertise and human resources to cope with reconfigurability.
And in (Aggeri and Segrestin 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Aggeri2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;), project
management methods were studied for their negative effects on collective
learning, and the critical implication for innovation department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in one of the chapters of the Cambridge Handbook of
Organizational Project Management, (Pollack 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Pollack2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;)
proposes to reconsider change management and project management given a
recent volume of the Project Management Institute entitled ‘Managing
Change in Organizations: A Practice Guide’. He underlines the risks of
not fully integrating change in management of portfolio, programs and
projects, may lead to change being a simple option. However the
challenge, is on the different perception of action in both fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Change management puts emphasis on communicating change, instead on the
definition and control of the change project delivery. What is the
contribution to exploration project to organizational ambidexterity?
Such cleavage on the encapsulation of exploration with respect to
established organization raises then several questions on the
by-products of the related generative processes on the organization
structure.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;risk-of-ad-hoc-epicormic-shoot-and-no-generative-learning&#34;&gt;Risk of ad-hoc: epicormic shoot and no generative learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous paragraphs show the tendency of project management to
require a temporary organization. Thus, it pushes further the notion of
matrix organization and potential decentralization as it requires more
flexibility, reconfigurability, scalability. It is a means to deal with
higher levels of uncertainty and potentially integrating the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that perspective (Hornstein 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hornstein2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;) makes a call
to merge organizational change and project management, as project should
be seen as proper organizational change initiative in order to integrate
also technical, social and behavioural issues. Otherwise, he recognizes
that an increasing number of project management enquiries are
integrating change elements focusing mainly on the process rather than
on the contingent dimensions. It has, then, a very different assumption
on organization design compared to organizational ambidexterity.&lt;br&gt;
(O’Reilly and Tushman 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-OReilly2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;) proposed to resolve the
spin-off strategy of the innovator’s dilemma by adopting an
organizational design supporting structural ambidexterity given high
strategic importance and operational leverage (see
Fig.&lt;a href=&#34;#fig:figoreilly2007&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;fig:figoreilly2007&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;).
Such design allows then balancing exploration and exploitation,
transferring, organizing learning given the crucial role of top
management’s leadership overseeing such global picture.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By comparison with (Christensen 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Christensen1997&#34;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;), where the
focus is on organization’s value and organization’s processes,
considering the operational leverage allows thinking of the host
organization supporting the team targeting the radical or disruptive
innovation. It creates the tension to find a &lt;em&gt;generative fit&lt;/em&gt; between
the project’s exploration and exploitation needs and constraints
(e.g. high entry barrier, technical complexity and certification). Of
course, it is not an end per se: (Engwall and Svensson

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Engwall2004a&#34;&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;) calls for &lt;em&gt;cheetah teams&lt;/em&gt; as an extreme
version of agile and reconfigurable projects that could be launched to
cope with urgent and unanticipated issues. This offshoot of a project
creates anyway some sort of paradox regarding the embedded nature of
projects (Sydow, Lindkvist, and Defillippi 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Sydow2004&#34;&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question could become then how centralized should the encapsulation
of exploration and adaptation be. As studied in (Siggelkow and Levinthal

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Siggelkow2003&#34;&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;) (de/)centralization is nor right or wrong
but rather they advocate a temporary decentralization to support
exploration and adaptation. They propose to play around
interdependencies of firm activities addressed by such temporary
structures to increase the performance of exploration and exploitation.
When considering the acquisitions of technologies as an exploration
enabler, (Puranam, Singh, and Zollo 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Puranam2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;) points out
the criticality of synchronization of the organizational shift with the
technological maturity. The notion of interdependence becomes key again
as an exploration project may disrupt &lt;em&gt;epistemic interdependencies&lt;/em&gt;
(Puranam, Raveendran, and Knudsen 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Puranam2012a&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the literature tends to stress mainly the importance of
governance and resources to steer these projects (Winch

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Winch2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;; Turner and Müller 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Turner2017a&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;).
Even when managers don’t fully understand projects (Loch, Mähring, and
Sommer 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Loch2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;), they are critical to discuss underlying
models and overcome crises to generate new alternatives. Contingency
perspectives will also stress the determinism of project trajectories
given history and context (Engwall 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Engwall2003&#34;&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;). So, to
avoid thinking that projects are simple tools, the unit of analysis
should be elevated to the thinking of temporary-organization as
discussed in the previous paragraphs (Packendorff

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Packendorff1995&#34;&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;). It could avoid the shortcomings of the
‘one-off’ project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another perspective, inspired by design, will tend to blend design
reasoning and theories to re-thinking organizations (Romme

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Romme2003&#34;&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;). Embedding generative processes across the
organization as general mindset and practice could enact
&lt;em&gt;design-oriented organization&lt;/em&gt; (Hatchuel, Weil, and Le Masson

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hatchuel2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;). The design-oriented organization would aim
at systematically creating positively deviant projects and programs that
rely on (generative) dynamic capabilities of the firm. It gives a fresh
look on intrapreneurship and corporate entrepreneurship, as generative
design rules across the firm would support such projects. It echoes the
works of Phanish Puranam quoted earlier, and still require further case
studies and detail to fully embody such models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking of generative processes across the firm, (Adler

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Adler1995&#34;&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;) reveals the dynamics of coordination tasks and
mechanisms during a product development’s life cycle (project framing,
design &amp;amp; development and manufacturing). The interdependencies revealed
by differences in the degree of novelty and degree of fit will call for
different coordination mechanisms (standards, schedules, mutual
adjustment and teams):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering project for exploration and exploitation underscores its
strategic dimension for the firm as discussed in (Adler and Obstfeld

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Adler2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;), and pictured below:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the risk of ad-hoc (temporary) organization supporting an
exploration project could easily become real as interdependencies slip
away. Poor stakeholder management where legitimacy building is key
(Hooge and Dalmasso 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hooge2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;; Eskerod

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Eskerod2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;) could accentuate the phenomenon. Governance,
for inter-organizational and multi-level perspectives, is necessary
(Sydow and Braun 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Sydow2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;) to address the traditionally
implicit technical/social/organizational interdependent facets in
temporary organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects calling for inter-organizational/departmental support show the
crucial role of &lt;em&gt;concurrent platform innovation process&lt;/em&gt; supporting the
temporary-organization of radical exploration project: e.g. electric car
developed in a traditional combustion car company (Von Pechmann et al.

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-VonPechmann2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;). However, as the industrial context may be
subject to a high rate of change, a full projectification of the firm
(Beaume, Maniak, and Midler 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Beaume2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;), the (feedback)
learning with functional department is rarely, if not never, addressed
with the respect to legacy engineering or other mirrored features of the
organizational structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An exploration project in a more or less developed project-based
organization can then lead to a spin-off. The fact that innovation
managed and encapsulated in exploration projects raises significant
questions for organizational coherence and design for ambidexterity. Be
it permanently ad-hoc or temporary organization driven by architectural
innovation (Henderson and Clark &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Henderson1990&#34;&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;), the image
of the epicormic shoot in plant biology is quite seducing. Wouldn’t it
call for the co-existence of exploration feeding from exploitation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is (perhaps) a positively deviant part of a tree that grows in a
place where it is not really supposed to be (e.g. tiny branch on the
lower tree trunk, instead of on the ground or on a fully developed
branch). It feeds from established resources, but perhaps it makes some
sense at higher unit of analysis as discussed for project-based
organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, it may be too reductive to consider projects not as
ephemeral but rather by trying to making them more permanent
(Müller-Seitz and Sydow &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Mueller2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;). Such non-termination
can also be sustained by learning mechanisms in-between projects in time
(Hartmann and Dorée &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hartmann2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;) but also in multi-project
perspective as we discuss in the following paragraphs. This added
time-scale and synergy, calls for some kind of organizational metabolism
if we carry on with the biological analogy. Metabolism would refer to
what comes out or is at the heard of interactions between processes
(projects) and structures (organization designs).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;portfolio-and-program-management-for-exploration&#34;&gt;Portfolio and program management for exploration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst taking the assumption we are in a project-based economy and
project-based organization, where the matrix form is further developed
with high levels of reconfigurability (Galbraith

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Galbraith2010&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;), the notion of portfolio and program
management allows revisiting the risk of the ad-hoc, the spin-off, and
the epicormic shoot with respect to the host organizational form. For
instance, by extending (Hobday 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hobday2000&#34;&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;), (Gemünden,
Lehner, and Kock 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Gemunden2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;) defines a project-based
organization insisting on the different levels of management that should
be aligned and integrated so that it can be declined around structure,
value and people management (see
Fig.&lt;a href=&#34;#fig:modelpbogemunden&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;fig:modelpbogemunden&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;management of single projects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;management of the project landscapes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;leadership of the project-oriented organization&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ecology of projects makes then a lot of sense and may sustain
innovation as described in (Von Pechmann et al.

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-VonPechmann2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;). It considers a projectified firm
(Renault), where radical projects will be systematically launched
through the interactions of strategy, programs and projects organized in
a temporary manner and fully serviced by functional departments. The
network of projects can also be seen as fishing net for value management
(Laursen 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Laursen2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;) which can be organized with a
multi-lineage approach of product development (R. Maniak and Midler

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Maniak2014b&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategic management will tend to balance the control and
open/emergent approach of this multi-project management (Kopmann, Kock,
and Killen 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Kopmann2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;), and tend to encourage the
establishment of a dedicated function, potentially requiring an
institutionalization of innovation (O’Connor 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-OConnor2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;).
Robert Burgelman in (Burgelman 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Burgelman1983a&#34;&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt;) had
questioned whether &amp;ldquo;structure follows strategy&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;strategy follows
structure&amp;rdquo;. He proposed new analytical lens insisting on the
interactions between strategic behaviour, corporate context and concept
of strategy to blur the lines between a purely induced strategy by top
management and the emergence of autonomous strategic activities. This
projectified view of the firm with exploration and exploitation taking
place on multiple levels and directions is quite in line with
R.Burgelman’s perspective. And it departs from the models of
ambidexterity, except for the contextual which blunt the edges of the
non-mutual conditioning between exploration and exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this ecology of projects, introducing the concept of trajectory
(Aubry and Lavoie-Tremblay 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Aubry2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;) - which can also be
found in the works of Rémi Maniak and Christophe Midler on Renault -
allows studying the interaction between projects and (project-based)
organization design over time. With an interactionist approach,
sensemaking and reflexivity was accounted before decisions associated
with organization design. Monique Aubry suggests that further
understanding should be developed around the sensemaking supporting
learning between projects and project managers as it will feed the
governance and leadership embodying the strategic management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of &lt;em&gt;program&lt;/em&gt; becomes quite stimulating to support this kind
of system thinking. It is defined by the International Project
Management Association and the Project Management Institute as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;a set of related projects and required organizational changes to
reach a strategic goal and to achieve the defined business benefits&lt;/em&gt;
(IPMA) &lt;em&gt;program as a group of related projects, subprograms, and
program activities that must be managed in a coordinated way in order
to achieve benefits that may not be obtained if they are managed
individually&lt;/em&gt; (PMI)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the portfolio and multi-project management, programs
emphasize the link between the projects whilst giving also more weight
to strategy, stakeholder management and complexity (Patanakul and Pinto

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Patanakul2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;). The strategy/execution of the program
involves then political work, flexibility and managing interdependencies
targeted and revealed by the criticality of uncertain technologies
developed along the way and to be integrated. The program also develops
a certain bureaucracy to administrate the portfolio with a Program
Management Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk management and change control are among their main tasks. Learning
mechanisms can also be centralized through lessons learnt through
project delivery. When discussing, for instance, corporate venture
capital investments (Keil, Zahra, and Maula 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Keil2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;), they
put forward factors influencing learning benefits for exploration and
exploitation. Entrepreneurial opportunities of the incumbents should be
articulated with skills and ideas showcased by start-ups, at it gives
way to previous generated opportunities or even generate further
opportunities for entrepreneurship. The portfolio level gives more
context and contrast to pool opportunities. It constitutes most of the
program governance contributing to exploration and exploitation
organizational learning as transactions are made with start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governance of portfolio of projects, seen as a program, and with
project-based organization gives more weight to a change project (Gareis

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Gareis2010&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;). The change management could then be fully
embedded in the project, instead of seeing it as a different management.
However, the tendency is to operate a dichotomy making change a project
and a technical project (e.g. product development), instead of embedding
change within the project. In a literature review on program management
(Martinsuo and Hoverfält 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Martinsuo2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;), Miia Martinsuo
develops propositions for future research on change program management
towards organizational capability as it has been moving from the
traditional plan &amp;amp; control approach as it integrates value management,
synergies across programs, stakeholder management in addition to a means
to succeed in the organization’s environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we have seen that unit of analysis of the portfolio of
projects, and more specifically, the notion of program management gives
more weight to the strategic management of the underlying projects. This
concern with respect to the project-based organization would then
emphasize the triad: structure, the value and people management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it also stressed is that there is a governance of such pool of
activities that is slightly shifted compared to the functional structure
as it answers directly to the environment through clients, instead of
&amp;ldquo;only&amp;rdquo; dealing with standards, regulations and sustaining a body of
knowledge. It gives then more weight to the project-based organization
and generative fit to be managed as exploration projects develop their
yet-to-be known trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, as ambidexterity could be managed at the program level to
potentially metabolize projects with organizations, we must now precise
the role of environment perception. Understanding the environment will
allow anticipating adaptation and thus adjust the program for change. To
metabolize could then refer to the dynamics of interactions between
projects, and how it contribute to organizational change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;change-project-and-the-environment&#34;&gt;Change project and the environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous section, we have discussed the organizational dimension
of project management and its implications for exploration projects
supporting generative processes as a means for innovation management. We
have shown that the literature in the field has come to a point where
project-based organization, seen as temporary organization, and an
extension of matrix organization, are state-of-art to support innovation
management. However, the literature reveals numerous limitations and has
made repeated calls to further merge the teachings of organization
studies and design to better understand the value management, human
resources management as well as interdependencies in between departments
and (temporary) organizations. We have also pointed that detailed work
from engineering and design management were able to address these
&lt;em&gt;epistemic interdependencies&lt;/em&gt; and introduce notions such as &lt;em&gt;generative
fit&lt;/em&gt; to support congruence in innovation management. These elements
could play a role in organization metabolism for ambidexterity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The encapsulated nature of the projects allows more flexibility and
potential reconfigurability that can be sustained through appropriate
governance, in a more efficient way than traditional centralized and
functional organizations. Of course, such concern is rather contingent
to the maturity of technology, the market rate of change, task
complexity and environment turbulence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of environment is perhaps easier to look at, seen from the
project perspective, as it concentrates collective action in a project
team. The adaptive model takes into account the environment by defining
what is external to the adaptive system. And the notion of environment
becomes more blurry with interactionism as the notions of boundaries in
a network may be hard to delimitate unless one is able to cluster. Where
does the firm’s environment start? How is it observed and managed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section will consider how the project-based management regards the
environment, with also a concern for the way in which the environment is
discussed in the adaptive and interactionist models. We have made the
assumption of the projectification of firms. And so far, we have seen it
can relate to ambidexterity models discussed in the previous chapter
depending on the level of analysis and viewpoint (structure, process,
social and system). To discuss these topics, we propose to draw from
system theory and developments by Maturana and Varela (see for instance
the analysis of images of organization in (Morgan

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Morgan2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;)). They introduce the concept of &lt;em&gt;autopoiesis&lt;/em&gt;
which interprets differently the frontier between system and environment
applied to biology. They introduce the idea that a system interacts with
the environment by thinking of it as a reflection and part of its own
organization&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The principles of autopoiesis (self-generation) are
based on autonomy, circularity and self-reference. The cognition of the
&amp;ldquo;environment&amp;rdquo; is constituted of patterns of variations and reference
points reflecting its own organization mode, so that the environment is
organized as an extension of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Firstly, we will start by looking at the way in which the environment is
responded to. Secondly, as projects and organizations will tend to
organize their extension in the environment, we will look at the open
innovation literature and its implications for project management. At
last, we will consider how the firm can reorganize or regenerate itself
to constantly address these patterns of variations engaged between the
system and its &amp;ldquo;environment&amp;rdquo;.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;responding-exploring-and-exploiting-to-the-environment&#34;&gt;Responding, exploring, and exploiting to the environment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teachings from previous experiences can encourage some kind of
responses to prepare in some way to the environment dynamics. Among the
variety of pre-emptive strategies (Macmillan

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Macmillan1983&#34;&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt;), timing to offer to the market a new concept
(product, service, feature, architecture etc.) through careful project
management is crucial, as it comes with its set of advantages and
disadvantages (Lieberman and Montgomery 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lieberman1988&#34;&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt;,

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lieberman1998&#34;&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;). As described by Lieberman, several firm’s
resources will be of different nature depending on the strategy (pioneer
or follower) and the decision to enter at a certain rank the new market.
The created value space will be dependent on luck and dynamic
capabilities (Teece, Pisano, and Shuen 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Teece1997&#34;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is dependent on numerous control variables, so given the tone of our
literature review, we propose the case where the market or operational
ecosystem’s dynamics are pretty stable with long development lead times.
There are no visible threats of new entrants due to high entry barriers
and strong dominant design (Abernathy and Utterback

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Abernathy1978&#34;&gt;1978&lt;/a&gt;). In those markets, the long term strategy is
to be able to be ready when the new dominant design comes out (Macmillan

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Macmillan1983&#34;&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt;; Christensen 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Christensen1997&#34;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;).
It becomes then complex to support the necessity to invest into
resources and dynamic capabilities for a risky and uncertain course of
action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having slack resources appear crucial to innovate, yet the relationship
between these two would be curvilinear (Herold, Jayaraman, and
Narayanaswamy 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Herold2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;; Nohria and Gulati

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Nohria1996&#34;&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;). The inverted U-shape relationship between
slack and innovation pushes the optimization game on extremely complex
grounds as it is also dependent on multiple control variables (Nohria
and Gulati 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Nohria1997&#34;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;). It is also stressed that the nature
of slack resources (absorption and rarity) will have a different effect
on product exploration/exploitation given the (non-)existence of
ecosystem’s threats (Voss, Sirdeshmukh, and Voss 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Voss2008&#34;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By referring to prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Kahneman1979a&#34;&gt;1979&lt;/a&gt;), they build upon the concept of framing and
anchoring to explain the moderating effects of the environment
perception on the nature of available resources&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Their research was
further developed to show different patterns of exploration/exploitation
relative to the environment (Voss and Voss 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Voss2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;). They
propose that the balancing of the two modes could be conducted along the
dimensions of the product and the market. They emphasize the known
paradoxical myopic behaviour of large established firms having the
resources but not implementing ambidexterity for product development,
and they also confirm the need for sustained market ambidexterity for
long-term growth. The latter can also be directly linked to the failure
of stage-gate models in project management as described in (Sethi and
Iqbal 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Sethi2008&#34;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;) which tend to make beforehand strong and
stable hypothesis on the environment. It questions again the actual
practice of product ambidexterity, and ways of sustaining
exploration/exploitation through project management, since the
ambidextrous organization design may not be observed in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The necessity to change the organization comes from the cognition of a
change in circumstances. One could also develop the need to adapt
further by exploring yet to be known alternatives and generating new
knowledge. Relying on real options theory for instance, (Fredberg

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Fredberg2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;) encourages to think of the importance of the
generation of options along the product development process. Bringing
design theory closer to real options allows then coping with high
uncertainty and turbulence of the environment, but also stresses how the
new choices and their value should be positioned in the real options
tree. This pattern recalls the notion of pre-emptive strategies
(Macmillan 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Macmillan1983&#34;&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt;, 17) with the idea that one should
shape one’s luck:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Good generals make their luck by shaping the odds in their favor and
by being able to spot and rapidly capitalize on every emergent
opportunity created by the mistakes of their opponents, or by the good
fortune they have helped to shape&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before jumping to tricking the new environment’s odds, the adaptive
model can still bring some valuable subtleties. By developing the
canonical bandit (Posen and Levinthal 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Posen2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;) -
extending James March’s model - Hart Posen and Daniel Levinthal develop
the idea that environment change decreases the rewards of exploratory
efforts at accumulating knowledge (inverted U-shape between the optimal
degree of adaptiveness of the search strategy and turbulence frequency).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So organizing change may induce a renewed focus on exploiting old
knowledge, beliefs and opportunities. For instance in (Jansen, Van Den
Bosch, and Volberda 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Jansen2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;), ambidexterity is studied
in relationship with organizational antecedents such as centralization,
formalization and connectedness. Such search strategies supporting
organizational adaptation will reflect the conception of environment’s
dynamism and competitiveness, i.e. a set of actions conditioned by
knowledge mapping of the (believed-)world (Posen and Levinthal

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Posen2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;, 598). However, the results of Justin Jansen and
colleagues, may be considered insufficient as the organizational choices
such as decentralization and environment dynamism will encourage
exploration. Nevertheless, the example of the General Motor’s car in
(Posen and Levinthal 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Posen2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;) shows the greater
exploration was not beneficial as they ended up with a poor
new-environmental fit because the turbulence devalued existing knowledge
and also devalued the chances of returns associated to generating new
knowledge. They consequently insist on the &lt;em&gt;finesse&lt;/em&gt; of such nuances of
exploration/exploitation and the unknown (Posen and Levinthal

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Posen2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;, 599):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The challenge for organizations is the ex-ante assessment of the
magnitudes of these two competing forces.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modes of exploration and exploitation do reveal that the non-mutual
conditioning of both could be revisited. At least, exploration project
management does bring a new flavour to adaptation and engagement with
environment. Consequently, the role of strategic leadership for
exploration and exploitation can then naturally be linked to the
influence of environmental dynamism (Jansen, Vera, and Crossan

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Jansen2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;). Still in the line of thought of ambidextrous
models, it places the emphasis on leadership and top-management role to
cope with such organizational challenges. But isn’t there an approach in
between to cope with organizational metabolism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These takeaways again encourage to promote the simultaneous thinking and
implementation of managements of project and organizational change as
discussed in previous paragraphs (Pollack 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Pollack2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;;
Hornstein 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hornstein2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relying on the product development literature and project management, we
find how different adaptive arrangements can be made at the product
design level. (Sanchez and Mahoney 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Sanchez1996&#34;&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;) develop the
knowledge management supported by modular product architecture reflected
in organization design. It reduces the cost and difficulties of adaptive
coordination. The environment dynamism and turbulence can then easily be
coped with as long as the architecture remains stable: the firm will
remain flexible with the modules’ boundaries. Leaving a loose structure
(Nogueira and Raz 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Nogueira2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;) will then prove beneficial
against turbulent environment specially if teams can (re-)organize the
product design. Such perspective is even further developed with the idea
of fractal organizations (Nonaka et al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Nonaka2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;) by
considering multiple interfaces at the project level (Nonaka, Hirose,
and Takeda 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Nonaka2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;). These meso-foundations allow
reconnecting with the locus where knowledge is generated and managed,
and the creative side of dynamic capabilities taking place at the
team-level and organized my middle management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, whilst insisting on interdependencies and drawing
from practices of product design and engineering, system engineering can
considerably provide an enhanced perspective on the governance of
project-based organization in complex environments. (Locatelli, Mancini,
and Romano 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Locatelli2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;) proposed to shift to a
&lt;em&gt;system-based&lt;/em&gt;, and thus a &lt;em&gt;system governance&lt;/em&gt;, with for instance
naturally embedding the system thinking and supporting the re-use of
system elements. The role of project management offices in governing
performance appears then crucial to prepare environment responses. For
instance, a temporary entity (&amp;ldquo;transition support office&amp;rdquo;) can be
designed to conduct change with permanent entities by addressing
paradoxes and challenges in order to support a learning process in the
project-based organization (Aubry, Richer, and Lavoie-Tremblay

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Aubry2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;). Adapting to the change of circumstances can
then be addressed by directly managing the adaptation of project rules
(project management office) and product/system design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These logics of engagement with the environment can be pushed even
further by considering the move to work closely with the origins of some
of these turbulences in the supplier-client relationship by moving from
a settled project management (co-development) to a more exploratory
context (co-innovation) (Maniak et al. &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Maniak2008&#34;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;). It
avoids the caveats of traditional logics of reacting to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In (Colfer and Baldwin &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Colfer2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;) - when discussing the
mirroring hypothesis - echoes of the fractal organizations of I.Nonaka
can be found with a call for collaboration across firm boundaries as a
means, to deal with &lt;em&gt;epistemic interdependencies&lt;/em&gt; (Puranam
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Puranam2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;). The simultaneity of project management
(through product development) and organizational change (in the form of
change project) is then reinforced. It encourages opening the boundaries
of innovation in a project-based organization, or even in a adaptive
model perspective. The generation of new alternatives, new knowledge by
interacting with the environment can then be fully embedded in the
project in order to value the exploitative or exploration dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;freeing-exploring-and-exploiting-innovation&#34;&gt;Freeing, exploring and exploiting innovation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to (Kline and Rosenberg 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Kline1986&#34;&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;) showcasing a
linear model of innovation, it becomes challenging to withstand it
against open innovation. Indeed, its complex nature will bring several
changes to the market, the social context and product system.
Reinforcing the interdependencies of the technology and economic realms,
the authors naturally call to open the innovation black box (economist
view) and the process of technologist. They have a tendency to forget
the market environment and its dynamics. The open innovation then
encourages to find the origin of such dynamics and place the product
development effort over such domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of lead-users (Hippel 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-VonHippel1986&#34;&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;,

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-VonHippel2005&#34;&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;) can be rallied support ideation and
valuation of new concepts. Bringing user input, supplier relationship
but also manufacturers (Franke 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Franke2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;; Hippel

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-VonHippel2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;) can then support innovation management for
the firm up to an extreme point where innovation is fully taken care of
by users (Hippel 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-VonHippel2016a&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;). Freeing innovation tends
to fully open economists’ black box, it severely challenges transaction
costs and incomplete contracts perspective such as (Aghion and Tirole

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Aghion1994a&#34;&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;) where innovation is simply described through
patents and funding. See figure below:&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-the-free-innovation-paradigm-and-the-producer-innovation-paradigm-von-hippel-2016ref-vonhippel2016a&#34;&gt;

    The free innovation paradigm and the producer innovation paradigm (von Hippel &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-VonHippel2016a&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;)
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining the interactions between the two paradigms can also be
organized as a means to manage the environment by collaboratively making
sense along the design with users themselves. It can create new
requirements and eventually new products (Magnusson, Matthing, and
Kristensson 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Magnusson2003&#34;&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;; Kristensson, Magnusson, and
Matthing 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Kristensson2002&#34;&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;; Hewing and Hölzle

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hewing2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;). In a similar way, the design-driven
perspective of innovation management, (Verganti and Dell’Era

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Verganti2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;) calls to identify and work with
&lt;em&gt;interpreters&lt;/em&gt; that could be better identified through a wider system
thinking, better understanding of the whole value chain and environment
awareness. We could then think of exploiting such potential innovation
sources for the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new loci of innovation (Lakhani, Lifshitz-Assaf, and Tushman

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lakhani2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;) create tensions to contour the organizational
boundaries, and they propose instead to approach this difficulty of
opening/closing boundaries by addressing the decomposition of tasks and
the knowledge distribution supporting problem-solving. It stresses again
the role of leadership to perform the associated strategic
decomposition, as a means to decide of organization designs. The
(strategic) decision-making comes back to the front seat or at least
shifting the attention to collaborative problem framing (and
decomposition) with some added uncertainty. Even with common generative
practices, the structure and formulation of complex problems are crucial
(Kavadias and Sommer 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Kavadias2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;), implying the importance
of mediators creative leadership or adequate design management tools to
regulate group dynamics (Ezzat, Le Masson, and Weil

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ezzat2017a&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;; Ezzat et al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ezzat2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;). The
collaboration means imply careful co-design practices (Berger et al.

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Berger2005&#34;&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;) and partnering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it has also been clarified how the role of co-creation enhances
exploration/exploitation learning in project-based organization
(Eriksson, Leiringer, and Szentes 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Eriksson2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;). Moving to
a &amp;ldquo;private-collective&amp;rdquo; model of innovation as in the case of open-source
software domain (Hippel and Krogh 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-VonHippel2003&#34;&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;) allows
shifting the paradigm from the traditionally private and closed producer
(Baldwin and Hippel 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Baldwin2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;). Consequently, this new
regime of exploitation/exploration of the environment deeply challenges
the conditioning of both constructs. The blur is stronger if one
considers that the entry-level of open-innovation practices in firms
consists in managing a pool of established and potential suppliers to be
more vigilant to changes coming from the downstream value-chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    This shift in the locus of change management encourages to revise the
nature of choices to be made to support innovation management at the
light of the environment turbulence, and organizational boundaries
nuances. How should organization prepare and organize such loci of
innovation? How should executives build up and regenerate competencies
given the multiple project trajectories?
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;competence-building-nesting-innovation-and-organizational-metabolism&#34;&gt;Competence building: nesting innovation and organizational metabolism?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of dynamic capabilities could be split into two adaptive and
creative ones according to (Nonaka, Hirose, and Takeda

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Nonaka2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;). They also need to be tailored and designed to
address such turbulence and complexity. These routines (Zollo and Winter

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Zollo2002&#34;&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;) embedded in the firm may be subject to
path-dependency, requiring to regenerate the dynamic capabilities
themselves; as the latter represent the ability to renew competencies in
order to sustain the environmental fit (Teece, Pisano, and Shuen

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Teece1997&#34;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;). This recombination or regeneration of a higher
level deeply questions the means to achieve this extraction from
potential lock-ins (Bessant, Stamm, and Moeslein

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Bessant2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What appears critical for such capability enabling the &amp;ldquo;renewal of the
renewal&amp;rdquo; of competencies supporting organizational adaptation, could be
seen in the management of the unknown. The open innovation context
showcases numerous proxies channelling the innovation effort (Howells

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Howells2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;), so the participation to intermediation allows
addressing collectively the risks and opportunities of generating new
knowledge and accreting it (Agogué et al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Agogue2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;). For
instance, by connecting, ad-hoc networks are created to collectively
commit to innovation, creation of legitimate place for collective
innovation (not a shared vision), sharing an agenda of open issues and
questions before sharing knowledge and potential answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case of the semi-conductor industry, joining forces to address the
unknown, reveals how they constitute a new path through clever
road-mapping activities supporting the generation of knowledge (Le
Masson et al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeMasson2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;). These phenomena also require a
specific analysis to understand the structuration process taking place
in such networks (Sydow et al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Sydow2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;) where hierarchy
is replaced by heterarchy reconsidering the leadership role around
collective roadmap activities: e.g. creation and gap filling
(Müller-Seitz and Sydow 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Muller-Seitz2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;; Lange et al.

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lange2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partnering with other firms are effectively a means to explore novel
fields, but the underlying cooperation relies on necessary coordination
mechanisms as well as cohesion. This mix was identified as crucial to
support collective action (Segrestin 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Segrestin2005&#34;&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;). It
also reveals critical questions on the legal framework supporting such
open-ended processes thus avoiding rigidities and formalism of
traditional business contracts. The lack of identification and tooling
for path-dependence and path-creation, be it collective or not, can lead
to a standstill as it is the case for orphan innovation (Agogué, Le
Masson, and Robinson 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Agogue2012a&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;) and under-performing
technologies biased by government-led incentives (Nemet

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Nemet2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, understanding through a relational and interactionist
lens, the management of genuine uncertainties, and the unknown in such
partnerships, alliances and networks becomes critical. It requires also
to distance from pure governance or contractual perspectives despite
being crucial, not only to reduce the costs and uncertainty associated
with incomplete knowledge (Sydow, Müller-Seitz, and Provan

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Sydow2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;). For instance, the existence of collectives such
as the famous Lunar Society of Birmingham (1765-1813) exhibits the
capacity to organize beyond the firm’s boundaries into the gaps of the
ecosystem left by the unknown (Le Masson and Weil

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeMasson2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;). Such groups materialize the links between
science and industry, in order to collectively define new problems,
address what is invisible, in contrast with the existing. Interfering in
such way &amp;ldquo;into&amp;rdquo; the firm’s environment allows guiding the action logics
towards what is potentially manageable with potential innovators (Neyer,
Bullinger, and Moeslein 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Neyer2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;). Sociotechnical
imaginaries can thus be managed to stimulate the ecosystem at stake
(Hooge and Le Du 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hooge2016a&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;) echoing at higher level the
use of metaphors to drive radical product development. This approach is
relieved from the flexibility and dynamic responses expected from the
firm as they generate a new space in its networks (Grant

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Grant1996&#34;&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the idea of the higher level capabilities called &lt;em&gt;regenerative
dynamic capabilities&lt;/em&gt; (Ambrosini, Bowman, and Collier

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ambrosini2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, S15) could perhaps be embodied as it frames
how firms &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;might modify and extend their current dynamic
capabilities&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. But this third-loop of learning (Leifer and Steinert

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Leifer2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;; McClory, Read, and Labib

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-McClory2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;) shows the issue of iterating the looping
process as path-dependency looms again at different loop levels. The
pattern can reach for the &lt;em&gt;hyper-environment&lt;/em&gt; by promoting a change of
leadership and external change agents. The trick comes from the
environment cognition seen at different management levels or for
different activities. Hence, it is critical to master the ability to
identify the fixation effects associated with the product design, the
environment, institutions but also organization design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By reconsidering the importance of action for human cognition (Barsalou

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Barsalou2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;), we have another argument in favour of the
role of design or generative processes in general. Action allows a
better understanding of the environment’s perception and its dynamics.
The notion of &lt;em&gt;cognitive fit&lt;/em&gt; (Martignoni, Menon, and Siggelkow

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Martignoni2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;) between mental-model of the decision-maker
and the strategic environment, can then be studied to see if it
contributes positively/negatively to exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They show that cognitive style (simplifier vs. complexifier) will be
better suited for different hierarchical levels (respectively lower and
upper). The decision-making for strategic leadership should rely on a

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance perception combined with the interdependence
representation, will then contribute to more or less exploration which
in return should encourage a more or less efficient choice in the real
performance landscape. However, this association should be carefully
handled, as we have also stressed that too much exploration does not
guarantee stationary payoffs (Posen and Levinthal

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Posen2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;). So the direction of generative processes could
be guided to inquire and interfere with the environment. Evaluating
objects at the frontier of a knowledge domain also reveals several
biases consistent with prospect theory and bounded rationality (Boudreau
et al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Boudreau2014&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;): lower scores for closer domains, and
the more novel prospects are associated with lower evaluations. It marks
again the edges of optimization and search models, and leaves room for
generative processes supported by design reasoning to articulate
performance ands its renewal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to the decision of exploring and exploiting, several
parameters are to be considered: guiding exploration project and
engaging with the environment, loci of innovation, but also the
project-based organization change. Structure and processes are
off-balanced by project trajectories. Since, we relied on several
biological analogies. The concept of metabolism could be another way of
formulating these management parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word extends and stresses the meaning of &lt;em&gt;metabole&lt;/em&gt; which means
&lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; from the Greek $\mu \epsilon \tau \alpha \beta o \lambda \eta$,
itself derived from the prefix &lt;em&gt;meta-&lt;/em&gt; (with, communal, in between,
after) and the noun &lt;em&gt;bole&lt;/em&gt; (throw, cast and also wiggle or dance&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).
So coming back to other introduced borrowed words (ecology of
generativity, epicormic offshoot and mutation), the metabolism is a
&lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; that is rather in between organs and physiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the immune system, among other metabolic &amp;ldquo;devices&amp;rdquo;,
generate numerous leucocytes (white blood cells) thanks to DNA
variations in order to create cells that are potentially able to fight
against threats detected in the body. It shows the capacity of creating
deviant cells (different DNA) which should be eliminated per se, but
that needed to potentially generating the adequate defence (Hallé

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Halle2004&#34;&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; XX). This small example gives an idea of the
different nature of metabolism by opposition to other processes
operating in a organic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, a developed environment cognition properly building
capabilities supporting innovation faces the daunting task of generating
choices and selecting them to probe interactions, interdependencies that
are potentially distributed across several loci of innovation.
Sustaining organization metabolism, embedding innovation practices and
organization change, could be a side-effect managed by exploration
management. These metabolisms could then contribute to organizational
ambidexterity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gap between exploration project management and models of ambidexterity
has been widening. As a matter of fact, the original aim of
organizational learning and adaptation was founded on a different
assumption of organization design. Project management and project-based
organization bring new dynamics that are not fully compatible as
described so far with previous models of ambidexterity. Several roles
such as intermediaries, roadmaps, sociotechnical imaginaries, and
gap-filling are potential clues to guide the cognitive fit and
generative fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, we are left with several unanswered question on the
management of fixation effect relative to cognition, the decomposition
of tasks, the update and extension of representations and organization
design. These questions will also have different weights and change in
nature depending if they are considered at the project level, the
program level or its governance. We consequently underline the
complexity of metabolism but also the importance to manage them to
sustain ambidexterity and innovation practices. Otherwise, these
practices could be phased out given their assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-conclusion-projects-as-generative-vehicles-unsettling-organization-learning-and-design&#34;&gt;Chapter conclusion: projects as generative vehicles unsettling organization learning and design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this second chapter of the literature review, we started by looking
at projects as vehicles to search for novelty. It introduced an
encapsulated way of dealing with collective action and ambidexterity.
The unknown is at the heart of and encapsulated in projects. The
separation between exploration and exploitation is addressed with new
concerns for organizational learning and adaption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This perspective brought a new way of thinking of adaptation and
interactions with the environment. The projectification of economy and
the refinements of the matrix organizational form have put to the fore
temporary organizations creating ties for project-based management. Such
temporary structure may not be fully phased with underlying functional
organization that takes care of legacy product designs, associated
knowledge management and control of technical and organization
interdependencies as they are mirrored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generativity associated with exploration projects may push the
temporary organization to a point where ties may be hard to understand
and justify. Projects may then float and anchoring them implies high
levels of reconfigurability of the organizations whilst taking on board
value management and numerous contingencies. The notion of &lt;em&gt;generative
fit&lt;/em&gt; becomes quite handy to merge design management closer to
organization design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the project-based organization requires careful management to
handle multiple projects at once, which should not be considered as
isolated phenomena. The refinements brought by portfolio management and
program management allow stretching the collective action encapsulated
in projects in a more easier way towards innovation and strategic
management. We have also stressed that the history of project management
is actually closer to innovation than to optimization-inspired methods.
The governance associated to this unit of analysis reveals the
environment cognition, and the associated &lt;em&gt;cognitive fit&lt;/em&gt; to be
maintained. The subsequent allocation of resources, decomposition of
tasks, problem formulation and strategic decision-making become rather
complex as it can be addressing several loci of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The systems engineering and tradition of detailed product development
literature have had the tendency to specify the way in which design
issues are dealt at technical level but also at the organizational and
social level. The importance of interdependencies and the way in which
temporary organizations or project management offices or even governance
could play with raises intriguing perspectives to conduct collective
action for innovation management. Not only twisting technical
interdependencies play a major role for product development but with the
organizational partial mirroring the change management comes closer to
actual project management. The nature of decision-making that we had
addressed in the first chapter takes now a whole different colour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the encapsulation of generative processes in project management
brings a different perspective of organization design and sustainable
innovation management. Advanced forms of the matrix organization with
temporary organization supporting project management or even change
project, raises numerous issues on the way the generativity of product
design practices can be conducted simultaneously with the dynamics and
change requirements of the host organizations. The tensions identified
not only fall dramatically into the realm of contingency and
difficulties to conduct managerial action, but it raises the potential
impact of fixation effects and interdependencies which are usually
targeted by efficient generative processes. Drawing from complexity
theory, fixation points and interdependencies knots could be viewed as
attractors where collective action anchors and burgeons. Consequently,
it would be interesting to see how projects can be driven by shifting
these attractors whilst managing their influence area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following chapter will review our findings made in the literature in
order to synthetically specify the three presented models and our
research questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note the more recent chapter in the Handbook of Research on
New Product Development published in 2018 is exactly the same. Only
the title of the chapter differs: &amp;ldquo;Institutionalizing an innovation
function : moving beyond the champion&amp;rdquo; instead of
&amp;ldquo;Institutionalizing corporate entrepreneurship as the firm’s
innovation function: reflections from a longitudinal research
program&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember J.March’s quote on using technologies of rationality:
(March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, 209): &lt;em&gt;It is argued that the link
between rationality and conventional knowledge keeps rational
technologies reliable but inhibits creative imagination. This
characterization seems plausible, but it probably underestimates the
potential contribution of rational technologies to foolishness and
radical visions.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Avital and Te’eni 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Avital2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, 352) defines the
generative fit for information systems as &lt;em&gt;the extent to which the
functionality and process support of a (computer) system are
designed to complement and enhance one’s innate generative capacity
in a particular task-driven context. Therefore, generative fit
enhances the human resources needed in the production of new,
ingenious, task-driven output configuration&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of the environment becomes relative to each system,
i.e. there is no external observer defining &amp;ldquo;boundaries&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rare case of the theory’s takeaways outside of finance (Barberis

rather complex to be fully deployed despite its modelling of future
cost/benefit reasoning. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the fields of observation, chance favours only the prepared mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Louis Pasteur&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our literature review, we have taken sides with the critical approach
of stress testing a founding paper with evolutions of innovation
management, project management but also with refinements of generative
processes brought by design reasoning, theory and engineering design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James March’s seed coming from problem-solving (March

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;), has spread from a concern of organizational
learning developing an adaptive model to being the fertile ground for
ambidexterity and innovation. The dichotomy operated between exploration
and exploitation regimes has fed numerous studies, with more emphasis on
the role of exploration, and confusion around what embodies really this
two constructs. The articles (Birkinshaw and Gupta

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Birkinshaw2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;; Gupta, Smith, and Shalley

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Gupta2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;) were critical in discussing the non-mutual
conditioning of exploration/exploitation as introduced by (March

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;). They sketched the idea that the divide between
these two may have changed in nature. They also encourage to think of it
on two separate dimensions and avoid only considering it as two ends on
a same continuum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In less than 30 years and approximately 20,000 citations, the adaptive
process of organizational learning rooted in a search-based model of
problem solving has been largely superseded with what innovation
management has become and its diverse approaches. The models, we have
studied based on the literature review address part of these evolutions
whilst still being all equally present in research and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have taken a stance regarding how generative processes challenge
exploration vs. exploitation and see how they contribute to models of
ambidexterity and how they are encapsulated in different modes of
collective action such as project management. The notion of exploration
is quite pervasive, and usually aims at supporting sustainable
innovation. However, by considering input from design theory and
reasoning, we have shown the numerous limitations, tensions left to how
coordination and collective action should be conducted. For example,
when considering the biology metaphors used in the literature and
introduced in the review: adaptive evolution calls for mutation and
selection, interactions call for an ecology of generativity,
encapsulation in projects may lead to epicormic shoots at odds with
organization design. The latter allowed questioning the nature and the
management of organizational metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The management load comes then in different ways for leadership, or top
management, middle management and agents, and raises in complexity when
dealing with the loci and nature of generativity. Management
prescriptions have had the tendency to call for advanced
decision-making, cognition and action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As these three pivoting dimensions are quite recurrent, we propose to
have an enlarged vision of decision-making. Inspired by the neo-Carnegie
research agenda (Gavetti, Levinthal, and Ocasio

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Gavetti2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, 531), we propose to stick with foundations
&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;behaviorally plausible, decision-centred perspective on
organizations&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. The stress test driven by design reasoning and theory
will support such effort. The research program tailored at Centre for
Scientific Management in Mines ParisTech started off from a former
tradition of studying implementation and performativity of operational
research tools and methods (Segrestin et al.

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Segrestin2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;). Later, it constituted itself as an
extension of H.Simon’s work: design theory and expandable rationality
(Hatchuel 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hatchuel2001a&#34;&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;). Our literature review at least
brings forward the originality of looping back with origins and more
‘traditional’ management issues as design theory and innovation
management have constituted its own path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We propose to first clarify the models of ambidexterity and management
of the unknown studied in our literature review with the following
descriptors: model of coordination and collective action and the
innovation potential of attraction covering the nature of generative
processes, environment cognition and organization design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These description elements will help us formulating our research
questions and preliminary hypotheses to set a course for the methodology
part and results.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;model-description-categories&#34;&gt;Model description categories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, we should start by clarifying the descriptors enabling a
clearer comparison between models as these were introduced all along the
literature review. We had started from James March’s seminal paper
(March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;) and methodological literature review
(Wilden et al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Wilden2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;) with a concern for
organizational learning, rationality and foolishness, and its
contribution to innovation management. Diving into the literature of
ambidexterity allowed giving another flavour to the dichotomy of
exploration/exploitation with some concern for organization design,
resource allocation, dynamic capabilities and paradoxes. As the question
of implementing ambidextrous organization and prescribing sometimes
heavily contingent recommendations, we proposed to look at the
decision-making and the contributions from generative processes
challenges. The second chapter, studied the projectification of the
economy and how innovation management could be encapsulated. Embedding
generative processes in the case of exploration-dedicated project,
raised numerous questions on the organization hosting such projects,
reconsidering the matrix and organic forms. Finally, the associated
organization design and decisions to be made accordingly permit
rethinking the environmental and cognitive fits in cope with change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another approach to our literature review and derived models would be
then to identify what are the designated &lt;strong&gt;models of collective
action&lt;/strong&gt;. In other words, it is the way in which the models are
prescribed and translated into managerial action. It embeds several
hypotheses and sets a manageable course of action. The second dimension
to medidate - due to the complexity induced by potentially distributed
generative processes across the firm and organization structures - would
be the &lt;strong&gt;innovation potential of attraction&lt;/strong&gt;. We suggest to break it
down in three. The first sub-category concerns &lt;strong&gt;generative processes&lt;/strong&gt;
and their ‘performance’. The latter cannot be fully isolated per se as
it has been extensively discussed throughout the literature review, we
propose to consider the second category: &lt;strong&gt;environment cognition&lt;/strong&gt;. And
finally, the last sub-category is the organization design. The concern
for attraction is inspired by complexity theory in the sense that
‘chaos’ can temporarily ‘organize’ itself around
near-point-of-equilibrium. Consequently, it allows us to add a concern
for how standalone generative practices will engage with the environment
and simultaneously mirror what is necessary in the &lt;strong&gt;organization
design&lt;/strong&gt; to support its own generativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same vein of the two previous chapters, we propose to picture our
dimensions and sub-categories by considering their ‘edges’ revealed by
the challenges sustained by the unknown and its management. It
delimitates the three models on those edges, which have been pointed out
by the stress test of design theories against innovation management,
organization studies and project management.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;model-of-collective-action&#34;&gt;Model of collective action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the research discussed in the literature review addressed in some
way how action should be carried out to support their model. Sometimes,
the recommendation was quite ‘meta’ allowing it to be transferrable to
different research domains, sometimes it was more centred on the agent
(decisions, responsibility, cognition, relationships) and in other cases
it was quite abstract with constructs such as dynamic capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loci of generative processes and their organization is depicted in
the way individuals, teams and organizations will contribute and
interfere with it. The drive and control of such generative forces is
placed on different management tools and individuals. The effort is
placed on the relationships and knowledge interplay (Hatchuel

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hatchuel2011b&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;; Segrestin et al.

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Segrestin2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;innovation-potential-of-attraction&#34;&gt;Innovation potential of attraction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innovation potential of attraction will be constituted by different
sub-categories contributing at different levels of the firm: individual,
technical, systemic, social and organizational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;generative-process&#34;&gt;Generative process&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generative processes come in different practices, more or less
formalized or even institutionalized. They have different generative
engine, leading action in different directions and contributing to the
valuation process in different ways. The innovation potential will come
from the novelty, the fluency and also defixation power (Smith, Ward,
and Schumacher 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Smith1993&#34;&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt;; Ward 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ward2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;,

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ward1994&#34;&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;; Agogué, Le Masson, and Robinson

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Agogue2012a&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;; Le Masson, Hatchuel, and Weil

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeMasson2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;; Houdé 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Houde1997&#34;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;). The attraction
comes from the way in which a group of individual participate to the
joint generative effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also crucial to understand the nature of fixation effects and
interdependencies addressed, and of course what is taken for granted in
the exploration process. The behavioural aspect appears critical as it
involves what bounds rationality, and what can expand it, and the tools
and methods used to support such constraint or effort. Specification of
mental models and performance beliefs to drive generativity will be key
as they address potential &lt;em&gt;epistemic interdependencies&lt;/em&gt; (Puranam,
Raveendran, and Knudsen 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Puranam2012a&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;environment-cognition&#34;&gt;Environment cognition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environment cognition relates to the generative processes locus and
its engagement into its environment. It considers mainly how the system
is shaped and how it regards its own extension with ‘environment’.
Different devices and mechanisms can be imagined to prepare for
uncertainty and the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only it targets the perception and decisions made to cope with the
environment, but also how action occurs purely as a means to engage with
the environment and deal with uncertainties and the unknown. The
&lt;em&gt;cognitive fit&lt;/em&gt; with elaboration of mental models will support the
appropriate &lt;em&gt;environmental fit&lt;/em&gt; (Martignoni, Menon, and Siggelkow

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Martignoni2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;; Posen and Levinthal

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Posen2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;). The innovation potential of attraction will be
supported by how the system’s extension into the environment is managed
through the generative process, implying some level of awareness that is
taken into account by different individuals (agents, middle/top
management).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;organization-design&#34;&gt;Organization design&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organization design was addressed in different ways in our literature
review. The forms adopted by the firm were seen as important to support
generative processes but it is also key to understand what contributes
to the implementation of outputs. Moreover the beliefs and alternatives
supporting the organization designs will be closely to product
development with the &lt;em&gt;mirroring hypothesis&lt;/em&gt; in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the organization design is supposed to be the result of a change to
better respond to the environment, this potential never-ending process
for turbulent and complex environment calls for a certain &lt;em&gt;generative
fit&lt;/em&gt; by opposition to the traditional &lt;em&gt;organizational fit&lt;/em&gt; (Avital and
Te’eni 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Avital2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;; Van de Ven, Ganco, and Hinings

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-VandeVen2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;). The innovation potential of attraction here
is then expressed by considering what make the structures to reshape
around a proposed or even sketched new organizational design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the organization design will support the generative processes,
engaging with environment if they metabolize through structure and
processes of the organization. Relationships and knowledge will
dynamically evolve in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-questions-and-preliminary-hypothesis&#34;&gt;Research questions and preliminary hypothesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portrait made with our descriptors and models drawn from the
literature review reveal the assumptions made by these and their
potential limitations. These mainly appear since we tasked ourselves to
use design theory and reasoning to stress test several foundational
approaches made at the edge of the literature in innovation management,
organization theory and project management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we propose to address that the fact that the original construct
of balancing of exploration/exploitation may have suffered to a point
where ambidexterity could severely jeopardize innovation management
(Birkinshaw and Gupta 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Birkinshaw2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;; Wilden et al.

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Wilden2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;; Gupta, Smith, and Shalley

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Gupta2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;). Such perspective is also valid for project
management as the tension of exploration/exploitation typifies the
nature and course of action of projects in the firm, and the associated
temporary organization (Lenfle 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lenfle2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it is almost unthinkable to fully discard such concept. So, we
propose to revisit the notion of adaptive process, along with
interactive and encapsulated models, at the light of generative
processes. We should, in a way, reconsider nuances between exploration
and exploitation, their definitions to regenerate ambidexterity
behaviour across the firm (cognition, product development, project) and
ambidextrous organization. More specifically, the relationship between
product design and organization design (Colfer and Baldwin

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Colfer2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;), and the importance of &lt;em&gt;epistemic
interdependencies&lt;/em&gt; could reveal ways of properly overcoming and managing
organization design fixations, thus enabling the hybridisation of
project and change management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, if we manage to regenerate such construct with the fresh
teachings of design theory and reasoning, we should of course be able to
validate it. We should then also specify the new regime of collective
action supporting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the descriptors and the projection of our three models derived
from the literature, we can identify several areas of commonalities. The
dichotomy is usually enforced between exploration and exploitation, with
of course, different value frames and performances. These modulations
emphasize the paradox of dealing with both no matter the unit of
analysis (middle/top management, organization design, project,
resources, routines, etc.). There is a &lt;strong&gt;non-mutual conditioning between
exploration and exploitation&lt;/strong&gt; presented across the literature streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, as exploitation picturing bounded rationality, exploration
could be driven by foolishness or irrationality. Chaos could then
perhaps provide some input for exploitation, but the role of
exploitation providing some grounds for exploration is rarely, if not
never, discussed (Wilden et al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Wilden2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;). Only James
March sketched a possibility of nuancing the dichotomy (March

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, 209)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is argued that the link between rationality and conventional
knowledge keeps rational technologies reliable but inhibits creative
imagination. This characterization seems plausible, but it probably
underestimates the potential contribution of rational technologies to
foolishness and radical visions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such cleavage is also enforced in the nature of project management for
exploration and the required organizational ties. Interactionism blurs
the dichotomy but instead raises numerous questions on the management
and control of organization design, identity and change direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to sum up, we propose to define a common model of non-mutual
conditioning between exploration and exploitation regimes. It is
declined over the four descriptors introduced earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innovation potential of attraction specify the non-mutuality between
the product design and development for radical innovation and
organization design. The mirroring hypothesis pictured a static view of
the mutuality, but we are interested in the change process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the interactionist perspective stressing the reciprocity
sustained through circulation of concepts, the emergent nature of value,
recombination of routines, the role of artefacts and metaphors, it is
not very clear how the managerial action is achieved to balance and
control design fixations and epistemic interdependencies. Especially,
they don’t necessarily review the separation of both regimes and how it
could be articulated differently. So there is also a non-mutual
conditioning of coordination and collective action across the different
level of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;General features of a model of &lt;strong&gt;non mutual conditioning&lt;/strong&gt; between exploration/exploitation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model of coordination and collective action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Not necessarily on the same continuum, exploration and exploitation call for two dissociate action regimes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Balancing is left as a paradox at different levels of analysis: structure (centralization, distribution), time and individuals.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generative processes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; The nature of generative processes supporting exploration appears quite free, random and sometimes even foolishness-based. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; Generativity of the product development may not be sustained by (temporary) organizations (floating issue). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; The performance and reference are light structured: reduced to a selection issue or sometimes to complex interactionist phenomenon.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment cognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.&lt;/strong&gt; One-way interaction: Environment to Organization. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.&lt;/strong&gt; The environment structures the response, nature and distribution of generative processes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;8.&lt;/strong&gt; The environment is used to augment the product development requirements.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.&lt;/strong&gt; Organization design is pre-conceived or uncontrolled. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;10.&lt;/strong&gt; Organization design creates gaps for managing generative processes and the dynamics of their organizational ties.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rq1-how-does-the-dichotomy-between-explorationexploitation-compromise-sustained-innovation&#34;&gt;RQ1: How does the dichotomy between exploration/exploitation compromise sustained innovation?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the difficulties raised by generative processes
challenging organizational forms and action regimes supporting
innovation, encourage us to specify: &lt;strong&gt;What are the characteristics of
exploration project management floating between intra-organization and
inter-organization settings?&lt;/strong&gt; It appears crucial to understand the
underlying mechanisms and tension points where generativity strikes
against organization boundaries and rules. Our interest is in linking
the design theories and product development with such concern to
contribute to questions raised in the literature (Gavetti, Levinthal,
and Ocasio 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Gavetti2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, 532):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;how organizational rules and routines interact with formal and
informal decision-making structures is an important unanswered
question that must be answered to develop a more integrated theory of
organizations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the separation operated by exploration and exploitation to
support organizational learning, and limitations addressed by
interactionist and project management literature, the construct of
ambidexterity may have been outdated by practices and literature
refinements in innovation management: &lt;strong&gt;Does the dichotomy of
exploration/exploitation jeopardize innovation management at the light
of generative processes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As suggested in the literature, nuances could be disentangled between
the exploration and exploitation regimes, so we could ask ourselves:
&lt;strong&gt;How generative processes contribute to exploration struggle with
exploitation constraints (design rules, fixation effects,
interdependencies)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Finally we can summarize our first target into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does the dichotomy between
exploration/exploitation compromise sustained innovation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the reader can guess, we propose to reveal a management anomaly with
respect to predictions of the literature models of ambidexterity. The
prescribed non-mutual conditioning between exploration and exploitation
clashes with generative processes specifically targeting the unknown.
Exploration projects have a means to encapsulate the management of the
unknown, and consequently drive innovation, but they can fail in the
long run because of ambidextrous organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, organizations design as well product engineering fixations
are not fully overcome through exploration project management nor
ambidexterity itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rq2-what-model-of-ambidexterity-can-be-designed-to-overcome-and-manage-organization-design-fixations&#34;&gt;RQ2: What model of ambidexterity can be designed to overcome and manage organization design fixations?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If exploration/exploitation dichotomy’s construct could actually kill
innovation, we need to tackle the underlying behavioural foundations in
order to disentangle associated difficulties. A first hint would be to
deeply revisit the way decision-making is constructed due to the
interference of generative processes supported by design reasoning and
theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several rules, fixation effects and &lt;strong&gt;epistemic interdependencies&lt;/strong&gt;,
which are representative of formal and informal patterns of
exploitation, could be directly addressed by exploration activities.
More precisely, they could be among the requirements and be the purpose
of generative processes to sustain innovation in the firm.&lt;strong&gt;How could
organization design and change be simultaneously managed along a radical
innovation project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;environment cognition&lt;/strong&gt; and the associated (mirrored)
&lt;strong&gt;organization design&lt;/strong&gt; bearing new product development projects reveal
their design rules, fixation effects when challenged by generative
processes. The &lt;strong&gt;ecology of concepts&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;organization mutations&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;epicormic shoots&lt;/strong&gt; triggered and challenged by exploration activities
as knowledge-interactions dynamics are constantly strained (Hatchuel

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hatchuel2011b&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;strong&gt;How does it metabolize with innovative
design, organizational concerns and strategy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose then to synthesize these questions and first assumptions
into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can ambidexterity be revisited to overcome and manage organization design fixations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By opposition with anomalies, we naturally explore what the mutual
conditioning between exploration and exploitation can bring to
exploration project management. The underlying problem-solving
foundation will be revisited by design theories, where the unknown is
its second core after knowledge, will help revealing so far hidden
variables. Rooting decision-design on fixations and interdependencies
will facilitate generation of alternatives and concepts. Such generation
will then effectively work on product design and organization design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This modelling effort will necessarily require testing with further case
studies but also experimentation. Given their context, the researcher’s
intervention, where generativity is driven be decision-design, will
raise several questions on contingent organizational routines, dynamic
capabilities, as well as interactions and reconfigurations supporting
organizational change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rq3-how-can-intrainter-bu-exploration-projects-be-metabolized-in-the-organization-to-support-radical-innovation-for-the-conglomerate&#34;&gt;RQ3: How can intra/inter-BU exploration projects be metabolized in the organization to support radical innovation for the conglomerate?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous two questions encouraged the detection of an anomaly in the
practice of innovation management and the design of a new model
reconfiguring and extending the domain of validity of the ambidexterity
construct. We consequently need to think of the managerial action of the
new model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since, we will propose to root our research in the field offered by a
conglomerate of SMEs evolving the aircraft equipment market (Zodiac
Aerospace), we propose to emphasize the organization design and
behavioural approaches arising from the inter-organizational
relationships. Thus, it heavily challenges the edges of interactive and
encapsulated models, as organization structures tend to be the
by-product of product development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, our last research question can be summarized into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can intra/inter-BU exploration projects be metabolized in the organization to support radical innovation for the conglomerate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Following the modelling effort, the associated testing and intervention,
provide means of actions to work (organization &amp;amp; product) design
fixations to surface interdependencies. Disentangling such knots offer a
new lens driving organization change and product innovation. New
interactions are created and routines are recombined through the
generation of alternatives and concepts relying conditioned by
exploitation. Overall, these dynamics contribute to organizational
metabolisms.
  &lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, we present the methodology deployed over the three
years of the PhD thesis. The methodology relies on an
intervention-research approach (Hatchuel and David

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hatchuel2008&#34;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;) facilitated by the CIFRE contract
(&lt;em&gt;Convention Industrielle de Formation par la REcherche&lt;/em&gt; - Industrial
Convention of Training through Research).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, in section &lt;a href=&#34;#principles-of-intervention-research-in-management&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,
we introduce the principles of intervention-research in management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in section &lt;a href=&#34;#anomaly-detection-and-modelling&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;,
we present the data collection process with the associated analysis
based on the literature model. We follow an anomaly detection
methodology in order to formulate a new model that was tested during the
last stretch of three years of the research program through validation
and application within ZA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final section &lt;a href=&#34;#role-and-position-of-the-researcher---intervention-research&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; portraits the position of the PhD candidate within the firm.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;principles-of-intervention-research-in-management&#34;&gt;Principles of intervention research in management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Intervention Research in Management (IRM) has been elaborated over
several decades of research partnerships at &lt;em&gt;Centre de Gestion
Scientifique&lt;/em&gt; (Hatchuel and David 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hatchuel2008&#34;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;).This
approach has proven efficient in revealing the intricacies of complex
managerial situations specially in the innovation management field with
the multiplicity and novelty of interactions, decisions, knowledge flows
in project and strategy management. IRM relies on two pillars: a
&lt;strong&gt;collaborative protocol and theoretical perspective&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim is not to solve a definite problem proposed by an organization.
The theoretical setting can actually be rather dull at the beginning
despite bearing a certain potential. Nonetheless, a dialectic between
&lt;em&gt;established-theories-in&lt;/em&gt; use and &lt;em&gt;contextual-established-in-use&lt;/em&gt; allows
improving models of action. The point is nor to perform change
management, but rather to gain an understanding of theories-in-use,
their performativity and how models of thought can evolve within the
business. This continuous monitoring between academia and industry
through the PhD candidate enables uncovering a real research issue
supported by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-conditions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;partner with a pioneering logic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;open management issue free interviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;contractual commitment to a research issue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;support of an academic team with research potential (PhD
directors/supervisors and research lab)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitoring principles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free interviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warranted isonomy&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidentiality of all individual interviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capacity to create new empirical material&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlled design&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management innovations evaluated as rational myths&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this set of conditions and practices, the outputs emerge naturally
following the dynamic and symmetric feedback supported by the PhD
candidate through his meetings, steering committees with academia and
industrial colleagues. It implies testing models of thought, frameworks
drawn from the literature, and models grounded on field data based on
the case studies conducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;initial-management-issue-formulation&#34;&gt;Initial management issue formulation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, the PhD research program was designed to address the topic
of economic performance of design at Airbus Aircraft. At that time, the
PhD candidate was already working within Zodiac Aerospace.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The
program discussed how design activities of project and program
management could be valued by alternative means to project objectives.
For instance, it raised that traditional learning mechanisms between
projects were hard to track such as spill-overs (Cohen and Levinthal

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Cohen1989a&#34;&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt;), and how learning could be managed from a
project to another in an efficient manner. The performance dimension,
its definition and underlying value management was central for the
topic. Today, as the PhD project was not launched in July 2015, it was
put on hold and is currently being dealt by a PhD fellow at CGS (Agathe
Gillain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this PhD subject would not come to life in its original form by 2015,
we proposed to reallocate the project to Zodiac Aerospace. With the
support of the Group HR management, a new sponsor was to be found:
Thierry Rouge Carrassat, Chief Technical and Innovation Officer for
Zodiac Aerospace. Several meetings were organized between the PhD
Directors and the CTO to provide information on the company, its
history, its context, innovation management practices and how the PhD
program would be framed by IRM methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic was adapted, it discarded part of the economic performance
axis: the topic recentred around the old dilemma of market-pull vs.
techno-push. ZA presented several cases trying to overcome the growing
rationalization of market-pull by aircraft manufacturers and airlines.
For instance, they had two development teams close enough to market
prescribers in order to try to anticipate market-pull trends and
formulate proposal of new products/services that could federate several
BUs for more added value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, as business units were highly profitable in their
respective niche-markets covered over the history of acquisitions,
corporate management had been sponsoring techno-push initiatives. These
were steered through a &lt;em&gt;Multi-BU committee&lt;/em&gt; showcasing a mix of top-down
and bottom-up approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another salient feature was the history of acquisitions and expansion
since the establishment of the company in 1896. Zodiac Aerospace was a
conglomerate of SMEs with individual responsibility for each BUs grouped
based on market segmentation and technology proximity into so-called:

&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/appendix/&#34;&gt;Appendix&lt;/a&gt;.
It is a clean copy of the submission made to the ANRT (&lt;em&gt;Agence Nationale
pour la Recherche et la Technologie&lt;/em&gt;) - the agency sponsoring the CIFRE
PhD Programs nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;phases-of-irm&#34;&gt;Phases of IRM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intervention research can be split into different phases that do not
necessarily represent a linear story in the research journey. The phases
are the following: feeling of discomfort, rational myth, intervention
and research, portraying a set of logics and change process.
Starting with this &lt;em&gt;feeling of discomfort&lt;/em&gt; with respect to the open
management issues identified, the researcher in an abductive fashion
starts generating hypothesis on raw data collected through open
interviews with a wide variety of actors across business units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation is followed by the definition and gradual elaboration
of a &lt;em&gt;rational myth&lt;/em&gt;. This myth reflects as a potential model, and
reference to rely on to explain and coordinate collective action. As
exposed by Bachelard in his thesis &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Essai sur la connaissance
approchée&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; (Essay on approximated knowledge) (Bachelard

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Bachelard1927&#34;&gt;1927&lt;/a&gt;) to explain scientific knowledge development
and constructivist epistemology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The order of sensibilities does not necessarily follow the salient
features, what we could call the &lt;span class=&#34;underline&#34;&gt;dynamic
topography of our experience&lt;/span&gt;. We indeed have little agreement
with the simplification of the prior phenomenon of every scientific
development. We think the primordial features stand out by themselves
and establish themselves forcibly to our study through their
generality. Nevertheless, sometimes it is the accident and not the
general that is explanation principle to the point where problems
should be overturned to restore the generality to the phenomenal
features the spirit had represented in special meaning.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should not be mistaken for serendipitous discoveries but his work
stresses the importance of experimentation, seen as the &lt;em&gt;contact between
Thought and Reality&lt;/em&gt; which is the only way of specifying the mode of
existence. The knowledge is thus approximated by a movement of
conjunction from Thought to Reality, which are supported by means of
&lt;em&gt;intervention and interaction&lt;/em&gt;. The gradual and often non-linear shaping
of knowledge allows the researcher to &lt;em&gt;portray a set of logics&lt;/em&gt;. Up to
this phasing, the purpose of the researcher is mainly to explain and
bring to the surface the rationality mobilized in the collective action.
In that regard, we adopt an &lt;em&gt;ordinary&lt;/em&gt; perspective of rationality
(Boudon 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Boudon2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;). We avoid the potential patchwork and
associated burst of the notion of rationality, and stunning relativism
that social sciences can sometimes produce. Of course, we cannot pretend
to discard existing theories that explain collective action through
according to different research programs (Lakatos

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Lakatos1980&#34;&gt;1980&lt;/a&gt;): utility, materiality, mechanistic or
cognitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The methodological individualism required to reveal the &lt;em&gt;set of logics&lt;/em&gt;,
and &lt;em&gt;rational myth&lt;/em&gt;, tends to adopt a cognitive approach to understand
social phenomena which are the implications of the individual actions
inspired by reasons. It is a means of avoiding pitfalls as explained by
R.Boudon (Boudon 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Boudon2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;): solipsism, psychologism,
procedural knowledge and programmatic approaches, dispositional
variables, restrictive axiomatic such as rational choice theory and
expressive rationality (Frega 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Frega2010&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;). So, we tend to
look for how these reasons are shaped within and without context. We
also identify the research program Max Weber’s proposition in his
treatise on the Sociology of Religion (Weber 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Weber1946&#34;&gt;1946&lt;/a&gt;,
280):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not ideas, but material and ideal interests directly govern men’s conduct. Yet very frequently the ‘world-images’ that have been created by ‘ideas’ have, like switchmen, determined the tracks along which action has been pushed by the dynamic of interest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researcher in his generative search will then test his evolving
understanding with the field through different &lt;em&gt;intervention and
interaction&lt;/em&gt; devices, acting as measuring devices and testing:
interviews, questions with given semantics, presentations of models,
steering committees, discussions with supervisors. And finally, there is
a need for predictability in the new understanding built by the
researcher which comes in the form of a &lt;em&gt;change process&lt;/em&gt;. This change
occurs mainly from the understanding of &lt;em&gt;Reality&lt;/em&gt; of the studied domain.
It does not necessarily imply the implementation of new management tool,
or rationality organizing collective action, but rather a learning
process due to the scientific understanding. We will come back to this
in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;#anomaly-detection-and-modelling&#34;&gt;following section&lt;/a&gt;,
as we propose a methodology of anomaly detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-collection&#34;&gt;Data collection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of data was collected in the group Zodiac Aerospace
through the variety of interactions with actors of the firm. Given the
nature of our research, a diverse sample of data type was sourced across
the research ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of the PhD journey until the end, a large sample of
resources: meeting minutes, presentations, TRL assessments,
technology/product roadmaps, project statements, project &amp;amp; program
documentation stored on local networks, intranet, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another set of data was gathered through active participation to
workshop, seminars, meetings where sometimes where the researcher was
invited for observation and we must add data collection with varying
degrees of intervention: writing workshops, working groups, interviews,
project meetings and seminars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;anomaly-detection-and-modelling&#34;&gt;Anomaly detection and modelling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we will present in the following sections and following chapters
(
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/&#34;&gt;Chapter 5&lt;/a&gt; ) we have a small-sample research contained in a large conglomerate of
SMEs. The different phases of IRM tend to overlap and provide feedback
between themselves. Overall, we have the three main categories of logics
interacting with each other(Dana and Dumez 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Dana2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the sample size and in order to provide meaningful results for
academia and practice, demonstrating a case of anomaly is key from a
statistical standpoint (Siggelkow 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Siggelkow2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;). The
purpose is to carefully observe a counter-example to the models
extracted from literature (see 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part3/&#34;&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt;),
then propose a new model explaining the phenomenon and extending
existing theories (see 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part4/&#34;&gt;Part 4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, we present how we mobilize the idea of comprehensive
research (Dana and Dumez 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Dana2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;; Dumez

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Dumez2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;) to elicit counter-examples of existing models in
the literature and design a new one. There are three main risks
associated highlighted by the method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract actors or being of reasons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circularity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equifinality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three major risks will serve as a baseline to promote
counter-factual reasoning with the elucidated anomalies by putting the
effort on creating a typology, stress mechanisms between levels of
analysis through a set unit of analysis, and proposition of a new
concept redefining and extending existing theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;detecting-an-anomaly-in-management&#34;&gt;Detecting an anomaly in management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the movements of a comprehensive research (Dana and Dumez

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Dana2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;) can be seen as a modulation of deductive
research. The selected literature and associated models tell us what to
observe when scouting the research ground, with a risk of being trapped
with circularity. The first step consisted in analysing theoretical
frameworks relating to ambidexterity, exploration project management,
strategy management and organizational design/studies in face of the
unknown. It is also a way of rephrasing the elaboration of the &lt;em&gt;rational
myth&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;set of logics portrait&lt;/em&gt;. Based on the literature review (see 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part1/&#34;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;), we were able to select several of these frameworks which are key to identify a phenomenon unknown to academic literature in contrast with
the synthesised model of &lt;strong&gt;non-mutual conditioning of exploration/exploitation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis requires to extract typologies and mechanisms of phenomena
observed in the selected literature that shed light on the anomaly. The
descriptors are introduced to stress issues and limitations already
identified in the literature. It will also facilitate the
instrumentation to describe the purpose of our research questions, hence
the anomalies and their implications (see 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part3/&#34;&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have selected the common descriptors: &lt;strong&gt;model of coordination and
collective action&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;innovation potential of attraction&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;generative
processes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;environment cognition&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;organization design&lt;/em&gt;). The
literature review aimed at stress testing major models of ambidexterity
in order to see that the construct had drifted overtime and locally
&lt;em&gt;delaminated&lt;/em&gt; as innovation management had evolve to embrace the unknown
specially with exploration project management. These were analysed with
inputs from design theories and reasoning embodying generative
processes. Several assumptions and limitations were identified with the
help of the descriptors as presented in the research questions (see 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part1/chapter3/&#34;&gt;chapter 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a first &lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part3/chapter6/&#34;&gt;chapter&lt;/a&gt;,
a first batch of results from selected case studies (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#associated-paper-writing&#34;&gt;table in following chapter&lt;/a&gt;)
will be presented revealing anomalies. This is based on the chosen
descriptors and synthesized version of the anomaly detection articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second &lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part3/chapter7/&#34;&gt;chapter&lt;/a&gt;,
we will then have to further specify these anomalies revealing in more
detail the limitations and underlying assumptions found in the
literature review (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part1/chapter3/&#34;&gt;research questions&lt;/a&gt;). Finally, the anomaly
detection should lay the requirements to build up a new model revisiting
and extending literature models in order to explain the abnormal
phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-analysis&#34;&gt;Data analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must mobilize a unit of analysis that opposes inference and abductive
logics. The first calls for explanations, typologies and mechanisms the
selected literature will allow us to observe. The second is more
independent from the literature and tends to extract what the research
ground can &amp;ldquo;tell us&amp;rdquo; through the variations observations and
interactions/interventions. The two are far from being independent in
practice, there is a constant confrontation bore by the researcher
himself echoing a declination of the Hawthorne Effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two different sets of data allow us to confront the two logics
separately over the collected documentation and the variety of field
notes (interviews, meetings and workshops participation). The unit of
analysis is crucial to elicit the articulation between the levels of
analysis (from the individual to the organization/ecosystem) and
associated mechanisms evolving through the timeline of the case studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we would tend to have a ‘&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mesoscopic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;’ approach as the typologies
drawn from the literature review, in association with event-system
theory invite us to play on different levels and temporalities (Griffin

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Griffin1993&#34;&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt;; Griffin and Ragin 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Griffin1994&#34;&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;;
Morgeson, Mitchell, and Liu 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Morgeson2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;). The other
benefit is that it forces the researcher to disentangle black-boxes that
may have been contoured in the literature such as &lt;em&gt;abstract actors&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;beings of reason&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose then to explicit the selected descriptors (see 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part1/chapter3/&#34;&gt;chapter 3&lt;/a&gt; over time as the decision-making and action is engaged by actors
(designers, engineers, managers, etc.), within projects and within
committees. We then suggest to look at the time-sequence of the
following derived descriptors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;decision/problem space design&lt;/strong&gt;: decision and problem formulation
is extracted from documentation and conducted interviews for the
different surveyed selected projects. The input from design theory
from a methodological standpoint also helps to envision a large
decision/problem space which was discussed with interviewees (as the
possible course of action).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;actual made decisions&lt;/strong&gt;: recorded from project history,
documentation and interviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;engaged course of action&lt;/strong&gt;: recorded from project history,
documentation and interviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;organization design&lt;/strong&gt;: supporting (temporary) organizations were
found in project documentations and interviews and also directly
observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, if we propose to represent a project management for a
standardized product development, the descriptors allow us to show the
linear and supposed stability that is adapted through risk management
procedures. The figure
&lt;a href=&#34;#fig:refdescriptors&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;fig:refdescriptors&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;
below gives an idea of how this would be done.&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-derived-descriptors-representation-for-a-emtraditionalem-development-project&#34;&gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/img/refdescriptors.png&#34; data-caption=&#34;Derived descriptors representation for a traditional development project&#34;&gt;

    Derived descriptors representation for a &lt;em&gt;traditional&lt;/em&gt; development project
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analytical lens remains very useful to draw the project trajectory,
its coordination mechanisms and collective action. However, we must
stress that it may also become chaotic as real life management, and
interaction with the environment and organizations is not without
obstacles. So we must highlight these obstacles and specify what the
literature models of &lt;strong&gt;non-mutual conditioning between exploration and
exploitation&lt;/strong&gt; would have predicted compared to the actual course action
depicted with our descriptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; In order to specify and make sense of these obstacles,
numerous control variables can of course be added as we have discussed
in the literature review to counter contingencies and concomitant
phenomena. Adding them may raise model’s fitness with data but not
necessarily up to a point of reaching perfect congruence from a
statistical viewpoint. Consequently, we will address some of common
control variables and clarify how influential they could have been or
not in order to make a case for the anomaly as easily as possible.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;modelling-naming-explaining-and-testing&#34;&gt;Modelling: Naming, explaining and testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the anomaly detection encourages the researcher to formalize a
new model mitigating some perspectives addressed by the research
questions and the observed phenomena. The novelty invites &lt;em&gt;naming&lt;/em&gt; the
phenomenon based on traces left by academics or practitioners to weave a
model from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new model is introduced in 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part4/&#34;&gt;Part 4&lt;/a&gt;,
it should be &lt;em&gt;free-standing&lt;/em&gt;: plausible on its own due to the showcased
logics of the conceptual argument (Siggelkow 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Siggelkow2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;,
21). Despite being backed by the cases, it also requires elevating the
model from the idiosyncrasy of the cases themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our model will support a novel explanation of the anomalies presented in
the chapters 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part4/chapter8/&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;
and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part4/chapter9/&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;
in 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part4/&#34;&gt;Part 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The validity of the model is presented in chapter [10]https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part4/chapter10/)
and in 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part5/&#34;&gt;Part 5&lt;/a&gt;
through the different ways in which the researcher intervened in the
research ground: contributions to projects and management procedures.
For IRM phasing, it corresponds to the establishment of a new &lt;em&gt;rational
myth&lt;/em&gt; proposing a new way of organizing collective action. The support
and reaction to this experimentation is detailed in the two chapters
where the model was experimented and validated by peers. Moreover, this
experimentation of the model validates the status of the model as a
building block providing an understanding of complex mechanisms, laying
a path along the research questions perspectives for a future theory
with exploratory hypotheses in 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part6/&#34;&gt;Part 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we have specified the different descriptors to detect the potential
anomalies, we need to be able to compare models derived from literature
with the case studies. We propose then in the following paragraphs the
adaptive, interactive and encapsulated models. They represent different
models of ambidexterity as we have seen throughout our literature review
along the chosen descriptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;adaptive model&lt;/strong&gt; is mainly concerned with responding to the
environment by organizing the firm in a way that it is a priori capable
to answer to potential changes. The generative processes such as radical
innovation are then structured by the organization design and
environment cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;interactive model&lt;/strong&gt; tends to deepen the contingencies of
generative processes by stressing the importance of relationships,
emergent new ones so that new routines can be recombined through the
open-ended network dynamics. The organization design are shaped to the
complexity of relationships tied through generative interactions.
The &lt;strong&gt;encapsulated model&lt;/strong&gt; brings a more ‘organic’ view by framing
generativity with the scope of a project supported by a temporary
organization also tied functionally to resource-providing organizations.
The change dynamics of the (temporary) organization are the mirror’s
image of the net of projects engaged with the environment and program
office/governance’s strategic input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;adaptive-model-coping-with-the-environments-dynamics&#34;&gt;Adaptive model: coping with the environment’s dynamics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the adaptive model, what is critical is the way in which the adaptive
process rooted in problem-solving, and by-extension decision-making
(probabilities on solutions), moved from organizational learning with a
concern for exploration and exploitation regime to being a key construct
to think the firm’s innovation performance in addition to having
competitive advantage. Mutations of the organization structure and
process are the answer to environment changes. Variation and selection
should be then managed to ensure an efficient exploration.
The other salient feature is that it tends to prescribe organization
design with different level of analysis that should be the
responsibility of top management as they are considered among the few to
bring system thinking and thus conduct strategy. The underlying
foundations such as decision-making and dynamic capabilities building
remain quite obscure (Birkinshaw and Gupta 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Birkinshaw2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;)
and may lead to complicated managerial action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model of coordination and collective action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innovation potential of attraction&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt; Generative processes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innovation potential of attraction&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt; Environment cognition&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innovation potential of attraction&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organization design&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Top management and leadership are the corner stone shaping the adaptive processes supporting innovation management. They oversee organizational learning and relationships balancing exploration and exploitation. Selection, valuation and strategic decision-making is their responsibility.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Generativity is supported by search-based processes to discover missing alternatives hidden by bounded rationality. Foolishness or simple landscape searching can uncover unbounded rational alternatives. The overall product development process tends to be by-product of the ambidextrous organization.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The environment offers the alternatives to the decision-maker and seeker. High levels of flexibility and capabilities are required to respond quickly enough to changes. Search-based behaviour help to prepare and build up capabilities to cope with the environment.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The firm should balance its organization structurally, sequentially or contextually (different levels of the system) to support exploration and exploitation regimes. Ambidextrous organizations are the norm, and the careful balance is chosen depending on the environment dynamics observability.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;interactive-model-enabling-an-ecology-of-generativity&#34;&gt;Interactive model: enabling an ecology of generativity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interactive model approaches the issue in a far more contingent way.
The circulation of concepts and interactions with artefacts contribute
to the exploration regime and simultaneously to the exploitation effort
as stakeholders take part in the process. The decision-making has a
tendency to be left on the back seat, as the engaging action with others
will allow addressing uncertainties and the unknown. Yet, organizing
open innovation, or freeing innovation raises the question of problem
formulation and deciding of its decomposition in the network of
interactions.
The organization boundaries can be easily blurred by the numerous
engagement of agents and artefacts with the environment. It naturally
reveals numerous question on the governance, if not control, of such
fractal organizations as the identity and purpose of the products being
developed could bring heterogeneity and incoherence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model of coordination and collective action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innovation potential of attraction&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt; Generative processes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innovation potential of attraction&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt; Environment cognition&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innovation potential of attraction&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organization design&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Middle management and individuals (designers and silent designers) bear the interactions. Spaces, occasions and artefacts should be designed. Top management may be involved to shape networks and relationships. Decision-making and problem framing may be required to be decomposed and distributed by top management.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interactions between agents and artefacts support circulation of meaning, create and manage value. Metaphors, desirable concepts are used to drive coordination and cohesion for radical innovation.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Flexibility is supported by the network and favours open innovation to reach out for new design requirements. Reaching out for the full value chain and extending it to user-designers allows shaping future environments. It is a means to formulate and solve problems.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Network and distributed design. Open/close boundaries on multiple fronts, potentially fractal. Organization tends to be a by-product of the product development processes in the network.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;encapsulated-model-challenging-organization-design-and-learning&#34;&gt;Encapsulated model: challenging organization design and learning&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The encapsulation of generative process into projects and the management
of a portfolio with a program elevate the interactive perspective by
putting the emphasis on strategic management, an enclose collective
action, as well as a potential issue of governance and temporary
organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temporary organization supporting the project-based management also
relies on functional departments providing key resources and knowledge
management. The organizational learning and organization ties of
projects floating across these organizations can induce difficulties
that encourage to think of change management with the scope of a given
project, instead of a separate activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innovation potential of attraction&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt; Environment cognition&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innovation potential of attraction&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organization design&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Project management and/or program management lead innovation. Project management office preserves project management rules. Program governance may frame projects with a roadmap and other strategic management input.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Practices, methods are embedded in project/program. Resources are drawn and requested depending on novelty.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Perception and action engaged locally, at project level and with possible oversight from program governance. Learning between projects is key to build awareness.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Projects shape temporary organizations relying on functional departments. The boundaries move according to environment interactions and may be governed by program management and office. Temporary organization tends to be a by-product of the product development processes supported by the portfolio of projects.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-journey&#34;&gt;Research Journey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, we present the research journey over the three years
corresponding to the IRM phasing and its modalities. The researcher took
part in several Steering Committees with the firm and PhD directors, as
well as numerous Academic confrontations which have participated to the
evolution of perception of literature frameworks and gradual
specification of a new &lt;em&gt;rational myth&lt;/em&gt;. The figure below gives a global
picture of the journey over several dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;

    Research journey
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;steering-committees&#34;&gt;Steering committees&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to elaborate the different phases of IRM, several steering
committees were organized on a quarterly basis with the academic and
industrial supervisors, in addition to weekly interactions with both
separately.
The first set of meetings gave a frame for an open discussion
(&lt;em&gt;isonomy&lt;/em&gt;) around a proposed model of action, framework projected over
the data collected on several case studies. Presentations and
discussions allowed testing hypothesis, different narratives, and
semantics taken from literature models. Two major meetings were
organized with the CTO, R&amp;amp;T, engineering and business development
managers, in addition to PhD Directors. Otherwise 10 other steering
committees were held with the CTO and PhD supervisors to keep track of
the &lt;em&gt;open management issue&lt;/em&gt;.
The second set of meetings were perhaps less formal as the challenge was
to update PhD supervisors as frequently as possible on the collected
data and analysis made. In a more personal way, it was the occasion for
the research to test extreme hypothesis or simple extrapolations in
order to explore the boundaries of the domain of the models taken from
the literature or grounded in the data. Practically, it implied testing
narratives, semantics from different literature streams to test how the
supervisors would project themselves in the understanding built by the
researcher. It is a dual learning process for both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;academic-confrontations&#34;&gt;Academic confrontations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research had the occasion to participate to a range of academic
activities: thesis presentation at the laboratory, presentation for the
annual PhD candidates meetings of the CNRS research unit (UMR 9237),
presentation at seminars, conferences and journal submissions with peer
reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the three years, the researcher engaged discussions with several
researchers to learn more from their publications and research
interests. It was the occasion to present the research project, results
of case studies and trying to find echoes with their works. The table
below offers an overview in a chronological order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Pierre Couronne&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Former Professor at &lt;em&gt;Université de Lille 3&lt;/em&gt; and at &lt;em&gt;ISAE SUPAERO-Toulouse&lt;/em&gt;, we had several discussions on the nature of design engineering and its contribution to management. His concern regarding the PhD project was seen from the angle of human resources and organization theory. His input was very helpful during the first months when trying to make sense and preliminary assumptions on the first cases analysed at ZA.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Gilles Garrel&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Professor of Management at &lt;em&gt;Conservatoire Natinal des Arts et Métiers (CNAM)&lt;/em&gt; - we had a first open exchange and shared a course together for the MSC in Entrepreneurship organized by &lt;em&gt;Ecole Polytechnique&lt;/em&gt; on bio-technologies. The purpose of this exchange was to share some insights on Zodiac Aerospace cases. He shed light with perspectives on project management and strategic management. He shared some experience on cases and ongoing research in creative (game and circus) and sport equipment industries.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Lisa Carlgren&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Post-doc at &lt;em&gt;Chalmers University&lt;/em&gt; - I had the occasion to review her EURAM 2016 submission, so we took time after the conference to discuss her research. Several insights on Design Thinking and its relationship to organization routines and strategic management were discussed. The discussion helped clarify the multiple impacts of design thinking (method) and design reasoning in general and the relative issues of framing &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34; data-cites=&#34;Carlgren2016a&#34;&gt;(Carlgren, Rauth, and Elmquist &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Carlgren2016a&#34; role=&#34;doc-biblioref&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Georg Von Krogh&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Professor of Management at &lt;em&gt;ETH Zürich&lt;/em&gt; - Discussion on the nature of need-solution pairs &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34; data-cites=&#34;VonHippel2016&#34;&gt;(Hippel and Krogh &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-VonHippel2016&#34; role=&#34;doc-biblioref&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; and the managerial action required to identify them and sustain an ecology of creativity. He suggested the reading of the edited books of Mark Runco and referring also the works of Robert Epstein.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Emmanuel Marcon&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Professor of Management and Business Intelligence at &lt;em&gt;IAE Poitiers&lt;/em&gt; - The exchange occurred following a PhD seminar on business intelligence organized by PSL University. Given his research and interactionist approaches on information gathering and processing, we had some debate on decision-making and its limitations. He encouraged the reading of &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34; data-cites=&#34;Oury1983&#34;&gt;(Oury and Schmidt &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Oury1983&#34; role=&#34;doc-biblioref&#34;&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; on the place of &#34;vigilance&#34; in economics. It allowed feeding a new approach to the paper submitted at ICED 2017 by insisting on the economy of project management and decision-making.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Laurent Simon&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Professor of Management at &lt;em&gt;HEC Montréal&lt;/em&gt; - Short meeting arranged during a visit to Montreal following ICED in Vancouver. After presenting the research conducted at ZA, he presented his research at Ubisoft &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34; data-cites=&#34;Cohendet2016 Simon2006&#34;&gt;(Cohendet and Simon &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Cohendet2016&#34; role=&#34;doc-biblioref&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;; Simon &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Simon2006&#34; role=&#34;doc-biblioref&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;. Whilst keeping a concern for organization routines, he gave reasons to work on how concepts are ‘forked’ during design processes (traceable through in C-K but not necessarily explained in detail) and these emergent micro-decisions are managed collectively. His concern echoed the criticality of linking design theory and management with organization theory, which we have addressed in the literature review.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Marine Agogué&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Assistant Professor of Management at &lt;em&gt;HEC Montréal&lt;/em&gt; - Short meeting arranged during a visit to Montreal following ICED in Vancouver. The discussion pointed out the design of decisions, and how the decision theory and design theory could be experimented in laboratory environment, or at least tracked in project management.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Florence Charue-Duboc&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor of Management at &lt;em&gt;CRG-Ecole Polytechnique&lt;/em&gt; - Several critical comments were made during my PhD status presentation, at &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 2nd year PhD Seminar (May 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It marks a key turning poing in the thesis&lt;/strong&gt;. Indeed, the purpose of the presentation was to try to show the anomaly. The presentation went awfully bad, but I took it as a weakness for not having the appropriate descriptors. As the notion organizational ambidexterity was discussed, the presentation was criticized for not nuancing enough the dichotomy between exploration/exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Laure Cabantous&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Professor of Management at &lt;em&gt;CASS Business School, University of London&lt;/em&gt; - The researcher was consulted for her work on decision-making with Alberto Feduzi &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34; data-cites=&#34;Feduzi2016&#34;&gt;(Feduzi et al. &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Feduzi2016&#34; role=&#34;doc-biblioref&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;. She raised interest in the cases in the decision-making practices of ZA and encouraged having a closer look at strategy-as-practice stream of research and legitimation with the firm.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Katharina Hölzle&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Professor of Management at &lt;em&gt;University of Potsdam - d.school&lt;/em&gt; at editor for CIM Journal - Following the CIM Community Workshop in Potsdam (November 2016) and gathered feedback, a submission was made to the CIM Journal. A first round of reviews pointed at several weaknesses of the submitted article including the multi-level analysis. Several months later, during a visit to Mines ParisTech, we took some time to discuss the paper. Misunderstandings were cleared out and together with Sophie Hooge, we had time to elaborate on the use of design theory and reasoning (practice and methodology) to understand the build up of dynamic capabilities sustaining innovation management in addition to conduct management research.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Sophie Hooge&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Assistant Professor - On several occasions, we had the opportunity to discuss the shades of ambidexterity and how ZA cases proved new practice requiring management tools and support. Her knowledge of the car industry was used as a reference to explicit how different the aircraft industry is, and the features brought by my research compared to literature on exploration project management and radical innovation.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Cédric Dalmasso&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Assistant Professor - During the last 6 months of the PhD, he was referred to for two articles co-authored on ambidexterity &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34; data-cites=&#34;Garcias2015&#34;&gt;(Garcias, Dalmasso, and Sardas &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Garcias2015&#34; role=&#34;doc-biblioref&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; and high uncertainty project management &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34; data-cites=&#34;Hooge2015&#34;&gt;(Hooge and Dalmasso &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hooge2015&#34; role=&#34;doc-biblioref&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;. Not being so engaged with design theory and reasoning as other researchers in the lab, but more familiar with decision-making, project management and organization studies, his feedback was very helpful in clarifying my narrative.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Philippe Lefebvre&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Assistant Professor - His courses on organization design and organization studies, and his research on engineering departments, were enlightening to test the anomaly detection and the models revising decision-making and organization design.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Pierre-Henri Wuillemin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Assistant Professor at &lt;em&gt;LIP6, Université Pierre &amp;amp; Marie Curie&lt;/em&gt; - When surveying literature on decision theory, a theoretical graph model (pyAgrum) was found to simulate decision problems. A meeting was set to discuss how the developed Python code could be extended to designing decisions, or at least simulating the effect of surprises. The main output was that the nature the probabilities and underlying algebra should be revisited to properly simulate such behaviour unless sticking multi-variate decision-making.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Matthias Troffaes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Associate Professor at &lt;em&gt;Durham University&lt;/em&gt; - Another Python model was found in the field of imprecise probabilities (Improb), thus opening an opportunity to model the design of alternatives and states of nature. However, again the model proved insufficient to model the design by a decision-maker.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Anaëlle Camarda &amp;amp; Mathieu Cassotti&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Post-doc at &lt;em&gt;Université Paris Descartes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CGS Mines ParisTech&lt;/em&gt;; Professor at &lt;em&gt;LaPsyDé, Université Paris Descartes&lt;/em&gt; - Following discussion with Marine Agogué, the idea of combining the experimental protocols of decision-making and creativity was discussed but reveals numerous obstacles as they have epistemic differences. It remains an open topic.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;evolution-of-the-rational-myth-contributors&#34;&gt;Evolution of the &lt;em&gt;rational myth&lt;/em&gt; contributors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this subsection, we propose to cover the literature journey of the
researcher. We briefly present how the modelling effort came around over
which literature was mobilized, in addition which articles were
presented at conferences and sent to journals. The elaboration of the
&lt;em&gt;rational myth&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;set of logics portrait&lt;/em&gt; is not a linear process. So
the following paragraphs are an &lt;em&gt;ex-post&lt;/em&gt; viewpoint of the PhD journey.
We have taken the liberty to make three categories for which articles
were written and presentations made on various occasions to test
literature models on case studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the reader will see, they do not follow the literature review
chapters 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part1/chapter1/&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part1/chapter2/&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;,
instead they follow the PhD candidate through the three years and how he
tested several frameworks to engage with academia. The researcher made a
first effort regarding the literature around the construct of
&amp;ldquo;decision-making&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;design thinking&amp;rdquo; before going into the field
&amp;ldquo;organizational ambidexterity&amp;rdquo; and ramifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;decision-making&#34;&gt;Decision-making&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the case study at ZSSM, we had the opportunity to study the
decision theories in order to explain the project management. Data was
presented in a way that it encouraged the decision-making study: the
story was told as sequences of events with commitment to decisions,
beliefs and their representation in several documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;rational-theories-of-choice&#34;&gt;Rational theories of choice&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we will see later, we proposed to test the validity of rational
models of choice, where rationality is seen as instrumental(Boudon

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Boudon2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;). Large reviews of decision theories were
executed: from the ones based on &lt;em&gt;maximum expected utility&lt;/em&gt; to
modulations made between the 1950s to early 1990s with models discussing
the underlying axiomatic and formulation mathematics. The works of
Allais, Kahnmenan, Tversky, Machina, Camerer, Giocolli, Quiggin,
G.Klein, Slovic, Regenwetter and Gilboa were paramount in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debates on rationality, coherence between decision, beliefs and action
were covered to understand how the construct of decision-making was
considered in different literature domains ranging from economics,
management to philosophy. It was also the occasion to make a detour
through mathematics with decision models using multi-criteria approaches
and imprecise probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;irrationality-in-decision-making&#34;&gt;Irrationality in decision-making&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of not being able to expect, changing the notion of utility
to deal with the way decisions are made, led the researcher to dive into
the way what makes irrationality and how the decisions are constructed.
So the perspective of ex-post construction of decision to justify the
course of action, and deviance according instrumental rationality was
addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, as we were looking to bridge a gap with design theories, considered
as a change of paradigm, we were looking for ways in which rationality
could be preserved and still extend decision-making with design theories
without falling in the trap of leaving model-out-of-domain phenomena to
dispositional variables such as irrationality or constructs determined
by ad-hoc phenomena such as Bourdieu’s &lt;em&gt;habitus&lt;/em&gt;. One could refer to the
books of Christophe Morel on absurd decisions, and the works Nils
Brunson for their perspective on irrationality and absurdity. However,
the researcher was more inspired by the works of Richard Bronk on the
importance of imagination and creativity in markets (Bronk

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Bronk2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;) as a means to propose extensions and deep
revisions of outdated models of Thought explaining Reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    The last two paragraph led to an article presented at the International
Conference on Engineering Design (Le Glatin, Le Masson, and Weil
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeGlatin2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeGlatin2017&#34;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;) and to a parallel
submission to CERN IdeaSquare Journal of Experimental Innovation (Le
Glatin, Le Masson, and Weil
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeGlatin2017a&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeGlatin2017a&#34;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;) (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/pub-leglatin2017a/&#34;&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt;).
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;strategy-management-and-politics-of-decision-making&#34;&gt;Strategy management and politics of decision-making&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, studying the role of strategy-making, strategy-as-practice,
encouraged the researcher to find ways of formalizing decisions in a
different way. The works of Crozier, Fredberg, Pettigrew, Sfez were key
to test other frameworks were the role-playing is mobilized. The
researcher discussed with Laurent Simon, who referred also to Laure
Cabantous for further debates on decision-making and emergent
strategies. The difficulty for the researcher was to make sense of the
observations. Some of decisions taken were not coherent with the course
of action or beliefs. Violations of rationality axiomatic could be
highlighted but as the outcomes were mitigated and questioned utility
and performance, a different model was to be found to add details to
known phenomena or substantiate anomalies in a novel model. A turning
point was reached with a detour through the literature of routines and
organizational ambidexterity. Indeed, stimulating papers with a
sociological perspective written by Fanny Simon and Albéric Tellier with
the &lt;em&gt;event system theory&lt;/em&gt; of Frederick Morgeson and &lt;em&gt;event-structure
analysis&lt;/em&gt; of Larry Griffin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;design-thinking&#34;&gt;Design Thinking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As two case studies were based on the use of Design Thinking (DT)
methodology, in-depth literature review was conducted to understand its
origins, evolution and complementarity with other design perspectives in
literature: design studies, design theories and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;design-thinking-in-organizations&#34;&gt;Design Thinking in organizations&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place of a creativity methods, supporting the Fuzzy Front End and a
subsequent efficient NPD, has been largely studied in the past decades
starting with creative problem solving, brainstorming, and more recently
with Design Thinking methodology. Since it came through practice mainly,
several academics starting in d.schools (Stanford and Potsdam) but also
Swedish researcher centres, worked towards positioning DT with respect
to engineering, creativity and innovation management and organization
studies also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as design in general is usually seen as a confined activity
confined to engineering, or perhaps strategy, or even organizational
design, several barriers were faced when trying to framing and valuing
DT as part of an ecology of routines in the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;design-theory-and-engineering&#34;&gt;Design Theory and engineering&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of design theory, design science, and engineering,
reaching out for their impact of the organization was not a easy task.
But, as the field appeared more structured, it helped as reference to
position DT and try to reach out for organizational issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;design-oriented-organization&#34;&gt;Design-Oriented Organization&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the tradition of works of design theories and the importance of
management devices in organization, embracing post-Simonian paradigm,
the works of design-oriented organizations for innovative capabilities
(Andy Dong, Armand Hatchuel). They place design as a generalized
activity taking place at all levels of the organized, hence requiring to
be carefully managed to sustain firm’s regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This literature complements existing literature on dynamic capabilities
and organizing for radical innovation (O’Connor, Dougherty, Leonard) but
also the contributing organizational routines needed to support these:
knowledge management, valuation, power and legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last three paragraph led to an article presented at 6th Creative
Innovation Management Community Workshop at University of Potsdam
d.school (Le Glatin, Le Masson, and Weil &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeGlatin2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;). The
latter was adapted after having some input of several researchers for a
submission at Creative Innovation Management Journal. The paper had
taken different frameworks in the literature whilst trying to bridge the
difficulty to link design theory literature with organization, and catch
Design Thinking in between. The editorial along with the reviewer
highlighted several weaknesses of the paper and asked to resubmit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several months of maturation, the researcher had the opportunity to
engage discussion with one of the editorial board members. Katharina
Hölzle insight was crucial and we realized we are addressing the same
issue despite the PhD candidate’s clumsy writing. Therefore, an extended
abstract had been submitted for the R&amp;amp;D Conference in Milano (2018), and
the re-writing of a full article for the conference (Le Glatin et al.
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeGlatin2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;) but also for a clean resubmission to CIM
Journal (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/pub-leglatin2018/&#34;&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;organizational-ambidexterity&#34;&gt;Organizational ambidexterity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, in the same way that the duality between
market-pull and techno-push was first addressed by the research project,
the researcher inquired on the model of ambidexterity. The motivation
for such topic started when trying to formalize a portfolio of case
studies, and projects observed at the intra/inter-BU level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;organizational-perspective&#34;&gt;Organizational perspective&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These projects were hard to label in the organizations. The belonging
and having appropriate management tools appeared critical to
interviewees and attendees of the PhD steering committees. They
acknowledged that projects all along where not fully exploration nor
fully exploitation. Consequently, the researcher looked for literature
items that would touch upon this grey zone contributing to strategy and
competitive advantage. Luckily, in recent years (2013-2015), several
authors such as Tushmann, Birkinshaw, O’Reilly pointed towards the
necessity to study decision-making and managerial capabilities to better
understand the translation of ambidexterity at a micro-level, beyond top
management and environment perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;exploration-vsexploitation-of-routines&#34;&gt;Exploration vs. exploitation of routines&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since ambidexterity can be approached in two main different ways.
Besides the organizational one, the other stresses the nature of
routines and they should be coordinated in a global way for
organizational learning. In 1991, March’s proposes a more behavioural
approach by considering problem-solving, theories of choice,
evolutionary theory and information-processing. This echoes the
decision-making issues mentioned earlier with an &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;
irrationality. The cases encouraged to conceptualize the possibility of
switching between modes, but also to find a middle ground avoiding the
dichotomy. In other words, a new kind of rationality where absurdities
and anomalies can be resolved, hence blurring the artificial separation
between exploration and exploitation or even forcing them to be over a
same continuum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;project-management&#34;&gt;Project Management&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, during the last stretch of the PhD journey, we reached out to
project management literature. Recent research on exploration project
management and the role of the unknown in such situation, have amended
the literature with new ways of addressing the tension between
exploration and exploitation. The works of Loch and Lenfle are now a
cornerstone in the field. Since the organizational studies were key for
the research, naturally we were drawn towards the role of matrix
organization, adhocracies, and more generally
temporary-based-organization in the field of project management. It was
a means to loop back with organizational design and by which means the
organization supports these projects: resources, routines and dynamic
capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test the understanding of the literature and its limitations, the
researcher also engaged in a critical presentation during a PhD Seminar
(June 2017) encouraging to clearly position the analysis and explain how
the described phenomena differs from the literature models. It was a
turning point in the journey since it encouraged the understanding of
presented anomalies and design of a new model resolving them. The notion
of &lt;em&gt;decisional ambidexterity&lt;/em&gt; was clarified and extended also with the
contribution to European Management Review article (Le Masson et al.
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeMasson2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;) (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/pub-lemasson2018/&#34;&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, a full article was sent to EURAM 2018 Conference (Le
Glatin, Le Masson, and Weil &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeGlatin2018a&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;) (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/pub-leglatin2018a/&#34;&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt;),
a synthesis for the Doctoral Colloquium was submitted. Finally, another
working paper will be submitted to future conferences (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/project/ambidexterity-exploration-exploitation/&#34;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;paper-writing-and-case-studies&#34;&gt;Paper writing and case studies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The several discussions, debates and literature reviews were key to
formalise reasoning into several papers. These are summarized and
reformulated here in the manuscript and can be extensively consulted in

&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/&#34;&gt;Publications&lt;/a&gt;. The associated case studies are briefly presented in the following chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous methodological sections, we have explained the intent to
demonstrate an anomaly. Three papers were written for this common
objective with different streams of literature. They are based on three
major cases representing the variety of innovation management. These are
presented in the first part of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#associated-paper-writing&#34;&gt;table&lt;/a&gt; in the followin chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a theoretical paper offers a model to reconcile with the anomaly.
Compared to published version (see 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/pub-lemasson2018/&#34;&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt;,
we propose in this manuscript an extension that is then discussed in the
last paper of this thesis (see second part of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#associated-paper-writing&#34;&gt;table&lt;/a&gt; in following chapter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;role-and-position-of-the-researcher---intervention-research&#34;&gt;Role and position of the researcher - Intervention Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, we explain what were the activities and relations of
the researcher but also employee of the firm. We explain the mission of
the Innovation Direction and how the researcher took part in it. We also
cover daily activities, main drivers of integration with respect to the
management issue at stake in the research project, and peculiarities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;being-part-of-the-innovation-direction&#34;&gt;Being part of the Innovation Direction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Innovation Direction was created in 2013, following the creation of
the Zodiac Scientific and Technical Council (ZSTC) by Thierry
Rouge-Carrassat. He had been in charge of engineering departments and
the general management of business units. In parallel, several
discussions with the Group Human Resources benchmarked how Research &amp;amp;
Technology or Research &amp;amp; Development was organized. Among the surveys,
it was decided to establish an “Experts Career” program that would value
technical careers besides the traditional management one and the program
management (ZA-H-5003 Expert Technical Career Path Standard). This dual
ladder model (Allen and Katz 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Allen1986&#34;&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;) was largely
inspired by the car equipment manufacturer Valéo. Thierry
Rouge-Carrassat had also previously established a dedicated R&amp;amp;T within
business unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEO, Olivier Zarrouati had decided to create a Group Technical &amp;amp;
Innovation Officer, and Thierry was offered the opportunity. With the
support of a consulting firm, management tools were introduced to offer
BUs means of managing the nascent dedicated R&amp;amp;T activity. Previously,
these were part of more traditional engineering activities designing
products for client demands, but induced high risk. A separate process
and structure was proposed to mitigate risks between an
upstream/exploratory set of activities compared to more
downstream/exploitative ones taking place in client programs (new
product development).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The management tools consisted in what is almost a standard for
aeronautics after having being one for the Department of Defence in the
United States of America: Technology Readiness Level and Technology Road
maps (Mankins 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Mankins2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;). Airbus and Boeing, in addition
to the institutions such as public funding schemes, certification
authorities have been in the past decades gradually introducing the
concept of technology readiness assessment in 9 levels. Some
discrepancies between scales can sometimes be observed such as Boeing’s
being longer one (see Boeing’s procedure PRO-5157 - Technology and
Application Readiness Criteria (Issue March 21, 2007)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Level&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Definition&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TRL1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Scientific research has resulted in the observation of basic principles for a given concept, these begin to be translated into more applied R&amp;amp;T.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TRL2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Technologies are identified for a given concept, and more than one application/environment is identified. Still speculative, no experimental proof or detailed analysis to support the conjecture.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TRL3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Applied research is initiated. Analytical studies to set the technologies into given environments, and lab based studies to physically validate predictions = proof-of-concept.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TRL4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Elements must be integrated to establish that the &amp;ldquo;pieces&amp;rdquo; will work together to achieve concept enabling levels of performance for the system. Low-fidelity, lab environment.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TRL5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fidelity of the elements being tested increases significantly. They must be integrated with reasonably realistic elements for testing.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TRL6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A major step in the level of fidelity of technology is demonstrated. A prototype is tested with the actual whole system application or only similar to the planned application but with the same technologies.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TRL7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;An actual system prototype demonstration is expected in a operational environment. The prototype should be near or at the scale of the planned operational system.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TRL8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;True system development, and full integration.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TRL9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The system is fully operational and in-service, it may included some final fixes if applicable.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;mission-definition&#34;&gt;Mission definition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researcher arrived in late July 2015 in the newly created team: a
CTO delegate for the Americas from the start in early 2014, the Director
of Intellectual Property had been recruited in October 2014 and the
Director of R&amp;amp;T European funded programs in May 2015. An additional
member was delegated at the Institute for Technology Research in
Toulouse (&lt;em&gt;IRT Saint-Exupéry&lt;/em&gt;) in charge of the department of Electrical
Systems. In the following months, an experienced project manager would
be hired to take care of a national program for metal additive layer
manufacturing, joined by a PhD candidate based in an university
laboratory in Orléans (&lt;em&gt;Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique
Aéronautique&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team was rather young in the group except for the CTO and the one
based in Toulouse, we were then all discovering the intricacies of the
group. We would share a lot of information and thoughts on what we would
discover as we held meetings across business units.
In December 14, 2015, team’s mission was defined, despite all being
already being autonomous in their functions (project management, patent
management, funding and R&amp;amp;T management support):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead the development of a long term technological vision with
associated tools &amp;amp; processes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manage efficiently the expertise and IP, develop relevant internal &amp;amp;
external partnerships and secure funding to ensure a sustainable
road map&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead the development of a long term technological vision with an
associated sustainable road map&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manage efficiently the expertise and IP, develop relevant internal &amp;amp;
external partnerships and secure funding by applying required tools
&amp;amp; processes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;phd-candidate-in-innovation-management-position&#34;&gt;PhD Candidate in Innovation Management position&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researcher would report to the CTO as he would potentially benefit
from the feedback from field work, analyses and model creation and
testing. Bi-weekly meetings were organized to keep track of what the
researcher was conducting, and potentially answer to his questions and
test hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On several occasions, the PhD Candidate took some of the CTO’s tasks.
These were quite varied but all served the research project in some way
or another. The table offers a glimpse of the different activities (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Activities&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TRL procedure&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;October-January 2016&lt;/em&gt; - Support Zodiac Seats France to implement the TRL assessment procedure and the management of technology handover between R&amp;amp;T and Development Engineering activities. Appropriation of the definitions given in the existing group procedures was mandatory and required further details and adaption to the local engineering context. The several workshop days organized for the R&amp;amp;T and Development Engineering departments helped the identification of a case study. Frequent discussion with managers for innovation management related issues, led to providing a training session on Innovative Design methods.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ZAOS Program Management&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;March-July 2016&lt;/em&gt; - Within the Zodiac Aerospace Operation System launched in 2016 as part of the Quality Management system. It established a common baseline for all business units to support program management activities. Several workshops were held by Operational Excellence team and the researcher contributed to stressing the link with R&amp;amp;T activities. It was also the occasion to get to know several other program managers and directors from across the firm and gain familiarity with the program management activities&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Strategy Management Review&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;June 2016&lt;/em&gt; - A review for the Cabin Branch on Technology and Product Roadmap was scheduled and the researcher represented the CTO to collect feedback on ongoing projects and communicate messages from the CTO&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ZAOS Develop &amp;amp; Sustain&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;November 2016 - March 2017&lt;/em&gt; - In the same way to the Program Management process, the parallel and supporting process of Developing and Sustaining products and services was defined. A baseline was created for all BUs and the researcher took the responsibility during workshops to synthesize, challenge and write the “Design &amp;amp; Develop” process. It was a key turning point to be fully comfortable with the processes and BU practices. The experience contributed to clarify the understanding of the decision-making process and &lt;em&gt;rational myth&lt;/em&gt; for development engineering activities.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;CORAC meetings&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;November 2017 - February 2018&lt;/em&gt; - For a topic related to connectivity and aircraft operations, the Council for Research in Civil Aviation (&lt;em&gt;Conseil pour la Recherche en Aviation Civile&lt;/em&gt;), the CTO invited the researcher to follow-up on these meetings where the main French aeronautical firms propose projects contributing to the given topics. Besides representing one of the only company relevant for aircraft cabin equipment, the content of the meetings largely contributing to the understanding of how firms showcase their strategy and perception of innovation in their ecosystem.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ZAOS Innovate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;November 2017 - April 2018&lt;/em&gt; - In a similar way to Program Management and Develop &amp;amp; Sustain processes, a new set of procedures were defined to fit the ZAOS framework. The researcher took the lead of the activities dedicated to technology roadmaps and innovation management, to propose extensions of earlier versions of procedures based on the case studies analyses and research journey.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;R&amp;amp;T Managers meeting&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A colleague of Zodiac Interconnect Europe launched a series of meeting dedicated to share practices, issues and knowledge on technology domains for R&amp;amp;T managers based in France. The researcher participated to these meetings to discuss their topics, present and test hypotheses built during the last year of the PhD journey.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-steps-and-gaining-autonomy&#34;&gt;First steps and gaining autonomy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From August to November 2015, the time was dedicated to gain
acquaintance with several business units, understand the purpose of the
Technical and Innovation Direction, as well as try to reveal potential
&lt;em&gt;open management issues&lt;/em&gt; for case studies supporting the research
project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;being-introduced-by-the-cto&#34;&gt;Being introduced by the CTO&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first month was fully dedicated to open discussions with several
managers (engineering, marketing, sales), technical experts and project
managers part of the middle management of BUs across the group. Meetings
were held in the corporate headquarters in Plaisir where several BU
representatives have offices, as well as several other
video-conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CTO had sent an email introducing the researcher’s PhD project to
the ZSTC community, as well as key experts and managers who have a
rather dense network within their business unit or across others. In
total, 15 employees were consulted. Not all of them contributed equally
to data collection. They were from 8 different business units all from
middle management and Direction committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researcher received a warm welcome from all interviewees who were
curious in finding what he could bring to their daily concerns. As these
first meetings were quite open, the setting was about having them tell
stories about their work, their projects, difficulties, good practices
and general management topics. They were in a favourable setting to
disclose valuable signals feeding a &lt;em&gt;feeling of discomfort&lt;/em&gt; guiding the
&lt;em&gt;rational myth&lt;/em&gt; sensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;first-intervention-trl-assessment-tool&#34;&gt;First intervention: TRL assessment tool&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the researcher was gradually being identified, recognized in the R&amp;amp;T
community, the R&amp;amp;T Manager of Zodiac Seats France (ZSFR) reached out for
support on the implementation of the TRL assessment, before
reconsidering the TRM structuring. The request originated from a demand
of funding scheme who steers carefully the progress of portfolio of
projects. TRL targets had been given and several debates occurred on the
understanding of their definitions, so they needed support on providing
accuracy to definition baseline given in the ZA procedure and justify
the TRL assessment through a proper tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four workshops were organized with the support and input of the CTO for
the first meetings. The researcher had benchmarked several business
units beforehand following the round of open interviews, and other
aeronautical firms for examples of TRL assessment use. Based on the
latter, a draft created by the researcher served as a basis for
discussions with R&amp;amp;T stakeholders at ZSFR to propose an update TRL
assessment tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A by-product of this intervention, a new ZA procedure was re-issued to
share the updated baseline definition with detailed tool to support
other BUs. The TRL was seen as an evaluation and not necessarily
associated with gates to be passed. Such perspective fed many debates on
the maturity assessment of systems or designs since technologies would
be integrated in a given product at some point. Thus, it also encouraged
the revision of the complementary procedure on &lt;em&gt;Technology Roadmap
definition, creation and sustaining&lt;/em&gt; and its articulation with Product
Roadmaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, the relationship established with the business unit led to
the identification of a case study on the engineering of a modular
platform for business class seat (see 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#business-class-seat-platform&#34;&gt;case description&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;master-courses-for-literature-frameworks&#34;&gt;Master courses for literature frameworks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel to the Zodiac Aerospace integration, during the months of
September-October, several courses were taken in the Design Engineering
curriculum of Mines ParisTech organized by the chair of Design Theory
and Methods for Innovation to confirm learnings on design theories,
innovation management, epistemology of management sciences and
organization studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These courses were taken in the perspective of gaining robustness over
certain topics related to the &lt;em&gt;feeling of discomfort&lt;/em&gt; originated from
the open management issues faced during the first set of open
interviews. It was also a means of trying different &lt;em&gt;set of logics
portraits&lt;/em&gt; to explain first batch of observations and further
observations through &lt;em&gt;intervention and interaction&lt;/em&gt; in the form of case
studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;surveying-bus-for-topics&#34;&gt;Surveying BUs for topics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As explained briefly, a first intervention was the opportunity to
identify a first case study at Zodiac Seats France on the engineering
design of a modular platform of business class seat. The rest of case
studies were mostly identified following the first interviews and
validation with the CTO. He played an important role in challenging the
interest of the case studies and serve as liaison with the managers at
stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the case identified at Zodiac Sensing and Systems
Management (ZSSM, former Intertechnique, and now called Zodiac Fuel and
Control Systems) came around as the CTO proposed to study a case of a
technology developed from scratch, above TRL6 and about to be integrated
in a Boeing aircraft program. The intent was to study a case of success
despite numerous difficulties along the way. A first interview was set
with the R&amp;amp;T Manager. The history of the project was told, but the
narrative did not reflect anything special besides collaboration issues
with Boeing and unfavourable conjecture due to commercial litigation
concerning other ZA business units. However, the manager had mentioned
another potential case study he quickly presented. The researcher looked
for feedback from the CTO and concurred to the idea that this other case
would perhaps reveal more stimulating management issues than the bumpy
road of the other project’s trajectory. Another interview was set to dig
deeper and try to grasp the manager’s motivation (see 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#icing-conditions-detection&#34;&gt;case description&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another case, the CTO introduced the researcher to the Airbus
Development Team for on-going projects and invited him to several other
meetings held by the Executive Committee to follow up on the concepts,
projects and several debates related to the activity domain and
associated innovation management issues (see 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#airbus-development-team---design-thinking-cases&#34;&gt;case description&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regular attendance to Executive Committee meetings for strategic
technologies and product/service concepts (see case description of

&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#multi-bu-committee&#34;&gt;Multi-BU meetings&lt;/a&gt;) also led to the acquaintance of other managers who
had a deep interest in understanding the performance and success of
their ongoing projects (see 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#connected-cabin&#34;&gt;case description&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CTO’s guidance through bi-weekly meetings focused on discussing the
researcher’s analysis, modelling, and collected data. These interactions
were key for the research trajectory in addition to the autonomy of the
researcher having built his relations/network across business units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;end-of-phd-and-autonomy&#34;&gt;End of PhD and autonomy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the second half of the PhD, as several case studies were ended
but required further analysis and modelling, the researcher had already
established regular contact with several R&amp;amp;T Managers or Director of
Engineering. Naturally, the researcher was requested for his
contributions to TRL assessment and TRM definition, as well as
procedures written for the Zodiac Aerospace Operational System (ZAOS)
(see 
&lt;a href=&#34;#phd-candidate-in-innovation-management-position%22&#34;&gt;table&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the researcher was gradually acknowledged among these
managers for his input on innovation management. For instance, the case
study and intervention for Zodiac Oxygen Systems Europe (ZOSE, see

&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#hypoxia-protection---researchers-intervention&#34;&gt;section&lt;/a&gt;)
was proposed by the R&amp;amp;T manager. He had started an internal program to
anticipate evolution and disruption of pilot oxygen masks to complement
the benchmark made by the marketing department. Creativity sessions were
considered and the researcher assisted the R&amp;amp;T team to organize them and
capitalize on the design efforts made as well as with the evaluation. In
parallel, an internal open innovation challenge had been organized by
the ZSTC, of which one topic concerned the comfort and functions
associated to the pilot protection against the risks of hypoxia.
Consequently, the researched helped transcribing the open innovation
outcomes into an innovative design mapping based on C-K theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the initiated program was carried on and partially
translated into an answer to a call for partners in the European funded
program: Clean Sky 2. Airbus was leader of the topic reviewing the
future pilot oxygen mask. A team was put in place at ZOSE and started
designing concepts dealing with the ill-defined problem presented in the
program. The researcher was invited again to help formalizing the
efforts made and explain their design process. The challenge was to
gradually explain how to address highly uncertain and unknown parameters
in their design process and discussions with the principal
partner/client (Airbus).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researcher was called to provide internal training, recognized by HR
department, for the R&amp;amp;T department of Zodiac Seats France. The training
consisted in an introduction to design theories, design regimes and a
workshop to practice. Another example, during the PhD writing, the
researcher had the opportunity to contribute to an innovative design
initiative at Zodiac Electrical Power Systems. Beyond the design issue,
in the same way as in the ZOSE case, the researcher intervened and
tested models based on his research, as part of the process of testing
the &lt;em&gt;set of logics&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;change process&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;advantages-and-risks-of-intervention-research-for-the-study&#34;&gt;Advantages and risks of intervention research for the study&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The position of the researcher, as an executive PhD given the CIFRE
convention, exposed him to valuable insight on open management issues
but also some potential &lt;em&gt;contamination&lt;/em&gt; of data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;catching-ctos-political-influence-and-complaining&#34;&gt;Catching CTO’s political influence and complaining&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being hosted at the Innovation Direction and studying the topic of
innovation management opened many doors in business units and corporate
meetings. It was quite easy to gather information during the first round
of interviews and the subsequent interactions with engineers, designers
and managers, as well as interventions in business units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On some rare occasions, some interviews were hard to manage as the
speech being held was very negative (complaining). The dialogue had to
be redirected towards proposing solutions, alternatives or different
management philosophy to deal with. And sometimes, the closeness to the
CTO was tentatively tried to put a word or find backup. Of course, these
are dimensions of daily life in organizations and reflect a certain
situation, but for the role of the researcher, it can complicate the
activity of separating a clean analysis from one that is contaminated by
potential superfluous details. For instance, the question of
irrationality and absurdity of decisions or lack of understanding of
strategies of some managers were hard cases that could have been quickly
put into the quarantine of useless collected data. Yet, the role of the
researcher is to propose hypotheses, new models that can explain Reality
and be predictive in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;being-consulted-for-multiple-and-varied-topics&#34;&gt;Being consulted for multiple and varied topics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, in a previous section on gaining autonomy, the researcher
had new opportunities to study cases, following Jacques Girin’s
&amp;ldquo;opportunistic methodology&amp;rdquo; and also introduced in the comprehensive
methodology as expressed by Hervé Dumez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, as new procedures had been written by the researcher for
the TRL assessment, the Internal Audit Team quite often relied on him to
provide appropriate recommendations to BUs. It was the occasion for the
researcher to bring additional information when interacting the
concerned R&amp;amp;T manager and try to probe the field in search for critical
events, shifts in their speech, or simply new projects catching one’s
attention: new design/technology embarking a organizational change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this chapter, we have presented the research journey over the last
three years. We covered how intervention research was implemented at
Zodiac Aerospace emphasizing the different movements of participating to
the firm’s activities, studying them and also gaining in reflexivity
with academic activities including meetings, seminars, presentations,
conferences and article writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the overarching research methodology, the literature review
highlighted several limitations and potential anomaly which were partly
confirmed through several interactions and difficulties faced by the
researcher in his academic interactions. We proposed how to address the
anomaly and the associate effort to name and model the novel phenomenon.
We put to the fore descriptors and synthetics models (adaptive,
interactive and encapsulated) to instrument the anomaly detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have also indicated several other activities of the
researcher in the firm and how fruitful the environment and interactions
were to facilitate the original research agenda and disentangle the
&lt;em&gt;open management issue&lt;/em&gt; with colleagues concerned by the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Chapter 5 - Presentation of the research field and justification of case studies</title>
      <link>https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/</link>

      <guid>https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, we start by presenting the aviation industry market and
specially the context of equipment manufacturers with current challenges
for this ecosystem (see 
&lt;a href=&#34;#aviation-industry-market&#34;&gt;section&lt;/a&gt;)
We insist through its history the nature of constraints, their
formalization and how the industry professionalized over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we continue by introducing our research ground and the specificity
of Zodiac Aerospace and how relevant it is for our research questions
(see 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part1/chapter3/&#34;&gt;chapter 3&lt;/a&gt;). The organization structure of this conglomerate of SMEs and
history of acquisitions is described in order to provide enough context
for the reader to grasp engineering and marketing challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will briefly present the selected cases (see 
&lt;a href=&#34;#case-studies-selection&#34;&gt;section&lt;/a&gt;)
before diving into the analysis in the following parts 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part3/&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part4/&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part5/&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;.
We explain the contribution of each case to our research methodology and
to article writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aviation-industry-market&#34;&gt;Aviation industry market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aviation industry started off with many successful and failed
attempts since the eighteenth century. It is only after the 19th century
industrial revolutions that investors and influencers started promoting
the development air balloons, Zeppelins and gliders along with
engine-powered aircrafts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, we develop the establishment and evolution of this
market, the challenges associated with product development, its
perspectives, and the position of a large equipment manufacturer such as
Zodiac Aerospace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources used for this section range for courses taken by the researcher
during his studies in aeronautical engineering (ISAE-SUPAERO), the
Museum of Conservatoire National des Arts-et-Métiers, public domain
documentation (Airbus/Boeing market forecasts and EASA/FAA documents)
and internal documentation provided by the communication office of
Zodiac Aerospace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;pioneering-establishment-and-consolidation&#34;&gt;Pioneering, establishment and consolidation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is usually recognized that the first flight of a fixed-wing
powered-aircraft was the &lt;em&gt;Éole&lt;/em&gt; in 1890, developed by Clément Ader with
the support of the Péreire family - who had previously financed part of
Hausman’s renovation. His works were an application of discoveries and
theoretical models formulated earlier in the century by George Cayley
(first fixed-wing glider and formulation of drag and lift forces and the
usefulness of cambered wings&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French Military Ministry had gained interest in his engineering
efforts who encouraged further experimentation with the support of the
ministry’s engineering departments, a council of professors and the
establishment of a school of &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;aircraftery&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
The subsequent developments led to &lt;em&gt;Avion II&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Avion III&lt;/em&gt; (see
Fig.&lt;a href=&#34;#fig:AderAvion3&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;fig:AderAvion3&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;),
the army had plans for observation and bombing. Several experiments were
conducted to master the aircraft. However, with the crash of &lt;em&gt;Avion
III&lt;/em&gt;, the difficulties to explain what lessons could be drawn, and the
secrecy imposed by the Army, left C.Ader without any further financial
support to continue the trial-and-error process started. As explained by
himself in his book (Ader 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ader1907&#34;&gt;1907&lt;/a&gt;), he may have started
too early and it would have been preferable to work publicly. It then
abandoned the legacy of the &lt;em&gt;Éole&lt;/em&gt; and his larger project of
contributing to the National Defence through the founding of a school
for aviation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clément Ader’s project would be fulfilled later by Colonel Jean-Baptiste
Roche when creating the Superior School of Aeronautics and Mechanical
Construction in 1909, now known under the name of ISAE-SUPAERO
(Toulouse)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But another trend had gained more visibility in parallel
to development attempts of rotating/fixed-wing aircrafts: hot air
balloons had been developed starting in 1784 with the &lt;em&gt;Intrépide&lt;/em&gt; flying
over the Versailles castle with Montgolfier brothers&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
Several &amp;ldquo;research companies&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;Société d’Études&lt;/em&gt;) were established to
develop airships with the support of investors (a key venture capitalist
at that time was Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe), politicians, and
academics from different institutions (Aéro-club de France, Science
Academy, Engineering Schools such as Mines ParisTech, Ecole
Polytechnique and St Cyr). For example, here are a few key names: Grands
Ateliers Aérostatiques du Champ-de-Mars by E.Surcouf in 1880, later
renamed Société Astra who would manufacture Wright brothers’ aircraft
under licence and Société &amp;ldquo;Mallet, Mélandri et de Pitray&amp;rdquo; in 1896 (later
named Zodiac in 1911)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. They had an industrial vision for these
applications that were the hype in that time in World Exhibitions. Along
with air races and numerous experiments, applications for the Army and
Transportation were also targeted as use cases. They had been validated
for instance during the American Civil War with the Union Army Balloon
Corps&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides airships, technology transfers and alternative approaches where
developed during the same period such as the effort of Alberto
Santos-Dumont with the famous 14bis (1906) and Demoiselle (1907)
fixed-wing aircrafts, Henry Fabre (first seaplane in 1910) and Coanda’s
first alleged jet engines (ducted air fan with combustion chamber in
1910), &lt;em&gt;Appareils d’Aviation Les Frères Voisin&lt;/em&gt; (est. 1906, later split
and integrated into what would become &lt;em&gt;Gnome&amp;amp;Rhône&lt;/em&gt; est. 1905, i.e.
SNECMA/Safran Aircraft Engines) and &lt;em&gt;Blériot Aéronautique&lt;/em&gt;, a
constituent of today’s Airbus along with former Dassault Aviation
(&lt;em&gt;Société des Avions Marcel Bloch&lt;/em&gt;, est. 1929) who had merged with
pioneering work of &lt;em&gt;Bréguet Aviation&lt;/em&gt; (est. 1911).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the list is not exhaustive, but we would like to stress the
numerous links tied by inventors and investors across several decades of
experiments, partnerships and industrial settings. And similar stories
could also be presented in other countries of Europe and North
America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frenzy was also channelled by the founding of companies such as
&lt;em&gt;Compagnie générale transaérienne&lt;/em&gt; (est.1908 by Blériot) &lt;em&gt;Compagnie des
Messagers Aériens&lt;/em&gt; (founded in 1919 by Bréguet, Blériot, Renault and
Caudron) and &lt;em&gt;Compagnie Générale Aéropostale&lt;/em&gt; (est. 1918, by
Pierre-Georges Latécoère) who created a market to sustain an emerging
industry besides military applications. The former would then be
acquired by growing competition, mergers to become Air France for
instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premises of the aviation industry was a collective effort of
engineering where a dominant design was gradually established discarding
airships for reliability issues. Different architectures with engines
moving from the back (pusher) to the front of the fuselage (tractor),
different profiles for lift and drag trade-offs (&amp;ldquo;canard configuration&amp;rdquo;,
box-kite) and steering/stability equipment (box-kite, dihedral, rudders,
ailerons), fixed wheels or idlers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    The value of the &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;aircraftery&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; took decades to be demonstrated with
trials made by a community of pioneers who thrived from building in
parallel an ecosystem and organizations supporting their product
designs: Army, influential investors, mutual investments and self
investment in the creation of market (e.g. mailing and transportation),
academic institution creation, learned societies, associations and
federations. This is a crucial aspect to emphasize as the setting of the
market was not a linear process, nor the lonely process of several
pioneers who demonstrated the superiority of product design.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-turning-point-jet-age&#34;&gt;A turning point: jet age&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following major improvements made during and after World War I (WWI),
the jet era would finally come to existence despite first tentative
steps made by Henri-Marie Coanda in 1910. The latter being marginalized
during the second exhibition of the International Aeronautic Salon in
October 1910 against standard designs and persisting
doubts/controversies on the actual airworthiness of the aircraft and the
engine (ducted air fan or actual jet engine). The figures below show the
Coanda-1910

versus the two dominant designs of that time: airships and unshrouded
propellers aircrafts
(&lt;a href=&#34;#sub:Salon1909&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;sub:Salon1909&#34;&gt;[sub:Salon1909]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As several records would be broken by aviators (distance, time and
speed), aircraft designers and manufacturers would also compete in
engineering novel engines, optimising propellers, materials, in addition
to wing and fuselage designs. For instance, one can recall the success
of &lt;em&gt;Blériot XI&lt;/em&gt; when crossing the English Channel against Antoinette
aircraft, encouraging its promotion during the 1st Paris Air show (see
Fig.
&lt;a href=&#34;#sub:Salon1909&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;sub:Salon1909&#34;&gt;[sub:Salon1909]&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceptual models and theoretical efforts were made by physicists and
engineers building upon the earlier works of George Cayley in the 19th
century. Besides the need for pilot training such as rudimentary
&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;tonneau Antoinette&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, wind tunnels were built to formalize design
parameters in addition to testing facilities sponsored by the army. For
example, Gustave Eiffel wind tunnels built in 1909 in Paris (Champ de
Mars) (Gallant 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Gallant2002&#34;&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;; Barr 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Barr1992&#34;&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;)
contributed not only to mechanical engineering for buildings but also to
aerodynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Transportation would only start to exist with several routes of
airships in North America and Europe, but with WWI bombers converted for
passengers, the first airlines were created and dedicated aircraft
designs such as the Farman Goliath F60 derived from the F50 bomber (see
Fig.
&lt;a href=&#34;#fig:GoliathF60a&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;fig:GoliathF60a&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;).
With increasing speeds, optimization of turbo-propellers, sonic speeds
can be reached at the propellers tips, so shrouded configurations can be
beneficial encouraging the development of ducted-fan and then turbofan,
a kind of jet engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advancements in jet engines became a major architectural innovation for
heavier-than-air aircrafts (Henderson and Clark

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Henderson1990&#34;&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;). It sets a milestone in the development of
long haul flights and commercial aviation. It would be hard to say that
it was unexpected for established industrial players. However, it raises
the issue of perception and cognition of change in product design
(incremental, radical, architectural and modular) and the ecosystem
deals with the emergence of this shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The onset of the jet era occurred with the commercial aviation
intensification, flight routes tailored supporting a wider phenomenon
usually dubbed &amp;ldquo;globalization&amp;rdquo;. Distances are shortened, leisure is
democratized for wider categories of population, with major emphasis put
on the efficiency of engines for airlines operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frequency and variety of aircraft missions across the globe also
raised numerous evolutions for safety and robustness. Redundancy is the
baseline for most aircraft systems (operational). Several other
architectural innovations can be listed in the evolution such as the
elimination of the Flight Engineer in the cockpit as a side-effect of
development of electronics and digital commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;major-players-and-market-organization&#34;&gt;Major players and market organization&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market is mainly organized by aircraft manufacturers who integrate
the systems and equipment (co-)designed by suppliers. It is hardly
impossible to avoid the prescription mechanisms associated to Boeing and
Airbus, and marginally by Bombardier, Embraer and increasingly Irkut and
Comac. Several mergers of engineering services and manufacturers
consolidated what Boeing and Airbus are today. For instance, Boeing
absorbed McDonnell Douglas, Airbus is the result of the merger of Sud
Aviation and Nord Aviation to become first Aérospatiale. Forces were
joined, redistributing the roles of among historic roles: airframers,
structural part engineering and aircraft integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the market can be seen as an oligopoly for systems and
equipment manufacturers. The whole being layered to meet the integration
requirements of the aircraft manufacturer. See Fig.

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After numerous series of mergers and acquisitions at all market levels,
the number of players has reduced drastically. This consolidation has
put a certain order and hierarchy in market relationships, encouraging
players to by-pass some players to gain insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can refer for instance to the mapping built by Grundman Advisory
from 1993 to 2016. A few more can be added such as Safran acquiring
Zodiac Aerospace and United Technologies Corporation (UTC) with Rockwell
Collins (who recently acquired B/E Aerospace). The very large mapping
(pdf format) can be accessed on Grundman’s Advisory news section:
&lt;em&gt;Aviation Week publishes Grundman Opinion, &amp;ldquo;A map of aerospace mergers
and acquisitions&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this context, airlines undergoing changes in demographics,
population displacement, market design (e.g. hub structure) have
evolving requirements for aircraft missions: longer routes, multiple
stopovers across a continent, low maintenance etc. The aircraft
manufactures perform a preliminary proposal to meet their key customers
(major airlines).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aircrafts can be categorized in now three groups: short/long haul, and
currently business magazines tend to introduce the concept of
&amp;ldquo;middle-of-market&amp;rdquo;. Below, Fig.
&lt;a href=&#34;#fig:AircraftMarketSegments&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;fig:AircraftMarketSegments&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;
shows along two &lt;em&gt;performance criteria&lt;/em&gt; the three sets of aircrafts.
Despite visual and alleged similarities between short/long haul
aircrafts, physics, design rules and systems’ architectures do not allow
a simple rule of three. Aircraft programs are spanned across roughly a
decade in average (from the early designs to first delivery) mobilizing
several suppliers in a co-development process and requirements cascaded
down along the hierarchy of product/service design.&lt;/p&gt;

    Aircraft Market Segments
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among suppliers, as most players are conglomerate of SMEs, these follow
in broad strokes the perimeters given by the ATA chapters (Air
Transportation Association). The classification is originally intended
for engineers and technicians performing repairs and maintenance duties
on aircrafts. Aircraft systems are covered from ATA no.20 to 92. For
example, ATA 44 corresponds to Cabin Systems, where one can find the
following sub-systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;44-00 General&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;44-10 Cabin Core System&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;44-20 In-flight Entertainment System&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;44-30 External Communication System&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;44-40 Cabin Mass Memory System&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;44-50 Cabin Monitoring System&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;44-60 Miscellaneous Cabin System&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one can see, it does not cover for instance several &amp;ldquo;monuments&amp;rdquo; found
in the cabin: seats, class dividers, lavatories, galleys, etc. ATA
follows a system architecture description and the cabin domain should be
seen as an area sanctuarised by airline for customization and branding.
Naturally, it has more players specialized equipment certified by
Technical Standard Order (TSO, see below for further details).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;importance-of-safety-and-regulations&#34;&gt;Importance of safety and regulations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First safety regulation can be associated with a publication of the
Paris Police headquarters dating from April 23, 1784. It followed the
flight of the hot air balloon built by the Montgolfier brothers in late
1783 for King Louis XVI at Versailles castle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It shall be unlawful to manufacture and lift off balloons and other
aerostatic machines with heaters using wine spirit, fire crackers and
other flammable materials and orders that all other aerostatic
balloons may not take-off without permission. Such permission shall
only be granted to people with recognized experience and
capability&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the early delays, the approach to aircraft safety came as insurance
for justifying on one hand what objects were safe and reliable according
to a set of standardized criteria and on the other hand the how and the
who required to design, develop and sustain these objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite some differences between the rules established for North America
and Europe - Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Aviation
Safety Agency (EASA) respectively - they ensure airworthiness&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; along
four main domains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitoring Safety issues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product Certified &amp;amp; Checked&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safety Rules &amp;amp; regulations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approved Organizations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These topics are declined in the certification process that is
recognized with the issue of Type Certificate for the aircraft and
associated scope covering critical systems and equipment (e.g.
electrical power generation and distribution). In addition, almost
standalone equipment such as engine have their own Type Certificate and
&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;less critical&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; equipment with Technical Standard Order (TSO); so
they can be qualified and certified with a relative independence from
the aircraft manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general process is described in the Fig.
&lt;a href=&#34;#fig:CertificationProcess&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;fig:CertificationProcess&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;
pictures the phases until the release of a form (e.g. EASA Form-1/FAA
8130-3) validating the conformity of the manufactured/repaired product
given an extensive list of justification documents issued by Design,
Manufacturing and Maintenance activities. The figure also insists on the
fact that airworthiness is maintained throughout the life of the
product, meaning until it is dismantled and removed from the aircraft
fleet.&lt;/p&gt;





  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-certification-process&#34;&gt;

    Certification Process
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The certification and crucial airworthiness aspect, a more technical set
of requirements are addressed by system/equipment/technology/material-specific standards. These are issued by several regulatory bodies such as SAE International (Society of Automotive Engineers) issuing Aerospace Recommended Practice (ARP),
EUROCAE (European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment), RTCA
(Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics) issuing standards for
instance &amp;ldquo;Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne
Equipment&amp;rdquo;, MIL-STD from the US Military Standard, etc. Qualification
and design processes requirements are largely compliant with these
standards in addition to customer requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) has greatly contributed to the standardization of processes with
ISO9100 / AS9100 (Aerospace Basic Quality System Standard).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;challenges-and-future-changes&#34;&gt;Challenges and future changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market is rapidly growing based on surveys and forecasts made by
Boeing and Airbus on yearly basis. Asia-Pacific countries are greatly
contributing to this trend with legacy aircrafts being retrofitted in
major American and European countries despite several external shocks.&lt;/p&gt;

    World Annual traffic evolution - Airbus Global Market Forecast 2017
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;35000 aircrafts will be delivered by 2036, among which 13000 are for
replacement and the rest being actual new deliveries growth. Traffic
will keep on increasing with rate per annum from 2.5% between advanced
countries up to 6.2% between emergent countries taking most of the
traffic share (40%). Finally, several other trends can be foreseen with
environmental considerations, passengers demographics and changing urban
mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;greener-aircrafts&#34;&gt;Greener aircrafts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rising awareness of human’s activity on Earth has also encouraged
the aviation industry to develop means of reducing its greenhouse effect
share. For instance, from the viewpoint of fuel combustion, optimizing
engines with a criteria such as number of passengers per kilometre per
litre of kerosene in addition to emitted $CO_2$ and $NOx$ particles per
number of passengers per kilometre. Tremendous engineering efforts were
made to enhance the efficiency of the combustion chambers, engine
sections (fan, compressor and turbines) and overall architecture
(by-pass). These efforts are still on going with open-rotor engine.
Taxiing of aircrafts could also be changed to avoid burning fuel with
electrical drive in landing gears or pushback car integrated on taxiing
rails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other architectures such as delta wing for commercial aircrafts and
V-formation flight (inspired by geese flying patterns) have been
imagined by industrial actors. These approaches also tend to think the
overall aircraft and its integration within the airspace and airports.
Incremental innovations however can be designed by using lighter
materials while guaranteeing strength. For instance, marginal
improvements on wingtips or using composite materials for the skin of
wings and fuselage reduce overall weight. Nevertheless, these
replacement are not modular as it dramatically reduces the
electromagnetic shielding required against thunderstorms or simple
electromagnetic interferences. Shielding should then be improved across
wirings and harnesses needed for fly-by-wire systems&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and several
other electricity powered devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A greener aircraft does not only imply optimization along several
green-performance-indicators exploiting the dominant design, nor
replacing some features, but also has a greater impact on the
architecture of the aircraft itself and sensitivity to the evolutions of
the aircraft integration (e.g. airport, air traffic patterns, flight
route demands, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;passenger-demographics-and-trends&#34;&gt;Passenger demographics and trends&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passengers through airlines interaction the evolution of the market.
Passengers are more and more observed and consulted by airlines,
aircraft manufacturers and equipment manufacturers. Beyond traditional
satisfaction survey, creativity sessions and ethnographic observations
in &amp;ldquo;labs&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the expectation of passengers are changing. Let us take, for
instance, the evolution of seats in the cabin. Historically, no
distinction existed. Then with the gradual democratization, class
segments were created: first, club and economy. The club disappeared to
be replaced by the idea of a business class, with now sometimes dense
business class, reducing the size of the first that aims for a
hotel-like experience. These nuances should also be declined depending
on culture and flight routes across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ageing population is another concern for cabin layout including: seating
and lavatories. Reduced mobility of certain categories of passengers
also causes several issues for seating, movement along corridors and
reaching for different cabin areas. Seats architecture and access are
modified, additional equipment to assist are also designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So called &lt;em&gt;millenials&lt;/em&gt; emphasize the rising ubiquity of (Internet)
connectivity on mainland and ground transportation. Airlines have been
gradually shaping the business model of connectivity with new suppliers
and services providers offering solutions guaranteeing an almost
continuous connectivity. From traditional shared displays hanging over
seats, to seat-centric inflight-entertainment, the passengers are now
also willing to connect to existing solutions: in-flight connectivity
(Wi-Fi and entertainment server) supported by antennae and ground/space
relays, and active/passive displays for mirror casting personal device
content or accessing airline provided content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These novelties being transferred from an evolving society and use cases
where aircraft experience may appear old fashioned. They bring numerous
uncertainties to a professionalized and highly constrained engineering.
New product development may then fit the given architecture but may also
encourage the generation of ad-hoc solutions and reconfiguration of
(epistemic) interdependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;urban-mobility&#34;&gt;Urban mobility&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, another major trend is the regain in urban mobility. The
reducing flight times and connecting time at stopovers, has dramatically
reduced distances across the globe. Combining this trend with city
expansion, road and general public transportation can become saturated
to point where other means must be developed. In cities of high
inequalities such as Sao Paulo, helicopters are an efficient alternative
to travel across the city avoid traffic jams for those who can afford.
Social imaginaries tend to contribute to urban mobility effort on
adapting aircraft to fly safely through the city skies. Science fiction
works in literature and movies have embodied these ideas for more than a
century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is gradually becoming a reality with Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle’s technologies developed in the past two decades. Automation,
algorithmic robustness, and mastering of flight dynamics for quadcopter
designs for instance were key in addressing the scaling of remote
control devices to civil/military applications, and up to autonomous
taxi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last 5 years, several initiatives, usually referred as Passenger
Drones, were launched. In China, &lt;em&gt;eHang 184&lt;/em&gt; flew early 2018, in
Germany, &lt;em&gt;Lilium&lt;/em&gt; is being developed, in Dubai and Germany the
&lt;em&gt;Volocopter&lt;/em&gt; was developed and test flights were conducted, Airbus has
two concepts developed in two different centres: a traditional
vertical-take-off and landing (VTOL) called &lt;em&gt;Vahana&lt;/em&gt;, and a modular
solution combined with car &lt;em&gt;Pop.Up&lt;/em&gt;. These passenger drones enable
on-demand air transportation expanding the horizons of taxi fleets and
personal/public transportation with safer means of flight travel that
are not reachable with traditional light aviation airworthiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolution of the market order and segmentation given the highlighted
trends encourage equipment manufacturers to carefully reconsider the way
products and services are developed. In the following section, we
develop how projects and programs are managed given the aviation history
depicted previously. Its professionalization has established rules,
processes and structures to support new product development which we
will address at the light of several novelties, increasing uncertainties
and the need to innovate, i.e. managing the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zodiac-aerospace-innovation-context&#34;&gt;Zodiac Aerospace Innovation Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, we propose to present the context of the research
project offered by Zodiac Aerospace. We cover its overall organization,
its history, examples of major innovations in the aviation industry and
how R&amp;amp;T and Innovation are managed across the group of SMEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;general-organization-conglomerate-of-smes&#34;&gt;General organization: conglomerate of SMEs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thesis was conducted at the Technical &amp;amp; Innovation Direction of
Zodiac Aerospace (ZSA, holding). Established in 1896 by Maurice Mallet,
the venture initially targeted airship and fabric engineering. It has
now turned into a large industrial group of 75 entities designing,
developing and manufacturing aeronautical equipment for
aircraft/helicopters manufacturer and airlines. These are located over
100 facilities across the globe and mainly centralized in Europe and
North America. In the last couple of decades, some facilities were
established in cost-competitive countries for the serial production of
some entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group of SMEs where each of them, with a few hundreds employees
each, equating to a total of 35,000, have their own responsibility and
performance logic. A light group holding of 200 employees with several
support functions have the challenge to manage the sometimes competing
SMEs due to the market structures and build up synergies targeted by the
executive committee. As shown in the following page, we present the
variety of Zodiac Aerospace products that can be found on an aircraft.
The segmentation by branches dates from 2015, but the current status is
a merge between Cabin &amp;amp; Structures and Galleys &amp;amp; Equipment (now called
Zodiac Cabin), and Aircraft Systems and Aerosafety (now called Zodiac
Aerosystems). Most equipment is represented by a single business unit,
overlap is rare between entities. For example, in the kitchen area
(galley) the configuration is the following with all separate
engineering departments, standards and regulations and sales channels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The galley structure (frame, panels and fixtures) is developed by
Zodiac Galleys Europe/US&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inserts (oven, boilers, coffee makers, bun warmers and ice
containers) are developed by Zodiac Electrical Inserts Europe/US&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trolleys designed by Zodiac Air Catering Equipment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lavatories are composed of the lining/decorative elements
(Zodiac Airline Interior Integration) and of toilet seat and
underlying water &amp;amp; waste systems (Zodiac Water &amp;amp; Waste Systems)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-history-of-complementary-niche-strategy&#34;&gt;A history of complementary niche strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zodiac Aerospace, actually stems from the separation with Zodiac Marine.
The former Zodiac Group had been expanding between seas and skies with
technology transfers from air balloons to inflatable boat&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and
several other extensions playing on complementarities to expand its
footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of mergers and acquisitions, leaving aside the former Zodiac
Marine group of entities, can be traced back to the seventies with EFA
(Parachutes in United States) reopening the aeronautics branch as shown
in the figure below (Fig.
&lt;a href=&#34;#fig:acquisitions&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;fig:acquisitions&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;).
The main drivers for acquisitions, as explained on Zodiac Aerospace
corporate presentation, are synthesized into five key principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversifying in businesses with a high technological content,
through internal and external growth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Favouring niche markets to rapidly attain leader positions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensuring steady growth in earnings per share&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporting customers over the long-term through a strong after-sales
activity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aligning our operations with the Principles of the Global Compact&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first group of acquisitions intended to gain stronghold in the
aircraft safety systems market whilst still developing some related
marine activities around rubber coated fabrics (Kléber Industries),
flexible tanks (Superflexit), parachutes (EFA, Parachutes de France) and
arresting/evacuation systems (Air Cruisers, Aerazur). The family
shareholders’ trust put in the newly appointed CEO Jean-Louis Gérondeau.
He led an external growth strategy helping the financial recovery and
building a strong position in the aircraft equipment market. The
strategy was then extended with several other niche markets (mainly
oligopoly) with high added value justified by complex engineering
know-how complying with safety and airworthiness regulations. For
instance, early nineties was the entry into the aircraft seating (Weber
Aircraft, Sicma Aero Seat), water &amp;amp; waste systems (Monogram/MAG Aero and
Avon) and oxygen devices as well as sensing and systems management
(Groupe Intertechnique).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, we have more than 40 acquisitions since late seventies which
enabled diversification around the inflatable boat decaying market with
sport and leisure perspectives. But mostly, the group regained a
leadership position in the aircraft equipment market by federating
numerous SMEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As told by Olivier Zarrouati&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; during an open interview in May 2018
conducted by the PhD candidate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We scouted our environment for niches with high added value, after a
selection process, we would then make sure that new business unit will
be able to perform and hold its position in the market. When it comes
then to innovative concepts, the trick is really to make sure they
understand the value of novelty on their own and not by forcing it by
top management.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mindset was also confirmed by a separate interview made with the
Vice President of the group, Maurice Pinault, former CEO of Zodiac
Marine activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;feats-of-engineering&#34;&gt;Feats of engineering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of Zodiac Aerospace has left several landmarks in the domain
of engineering. Starting the nascent airship venture, engineering
know-how was developed for fabric engineering and sewing techniques.
Then, when redeveloping the company in the aircraft market over less
than three decades, the group developed its competencies in complex
engineering for aircraft systems, and material and stress engineering
for cabin equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;technical-fabric-and-associated-technologies&#34;&gt;Technical fabric and associated technologies&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airship industry at the wake of the $20^{th}$ century required not
only building an understanding of models of flight mechanics but being
able to design, engineering and manufacture robust fabric assemblies.
Standards of quality or test engineering were being gradually
established. Tensile strength of a piece of a fabric was crucial but
sewing techniques was an even more critical feature of these assemblies.
Advanced Sewing techniques were required for overall resistance to
aerodynamic forces (lift and drag) and associated designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With growing competition in an established market of inflatable boat,
Zodiac Aerospace managed to expand these competencies with the parachute
industry, inflatable boats, airbags, emergency evacuation systems
(slides, life rafts) and arresting systems (nets and harnesses on
runways). Several of these high skilled work can also be observed in
weaving and braiding techniques for conduits and hoses for harsh
environments. The developed industry thus greatly differs from clothing
industry with safety and airworthiness standards that imply a wide
spectrum of physical variables (temperature, tensile in static/dynamic
modes). It has greatly contributed to the unique position in a
quasi-duopoly with strong commercial and technical bonds with aircraft
manufacturers (Airbus, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zodiac Aerospace has dominated the market of Parachutes, aircraft
arresting and evacuation systems and also part of the market associated
with braided/woven products. Unique technologies were developed to
remain competitive in several areas: flexible fuel tanks, open sleeves
for electrical harnesses and net arresting systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;composites-materials-and-cabin-equipment&#34;&gt;Composites materials and cabin equipment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early nineties, the Zodiac group had been developing the leisure and
sport marine domain to expand the inflatable boat market (Zodiac, Avon
and Bombard product lines). Their entry into the aircraft seating market
was done through Weber company who also had several engineering and
manufacturing capabilities in aircraft parts and synergies with its
former conglomerate Walter Kidde and Company Inc who had sold the
business to a largely diversified British conglomerate (Hanson
PLC).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Kidde had also a foot in the inflatable boat market during
the war effort. A similar move was operated with SICMA in France, which
had been developing aircraft structural part, seats and also skis and
tennis rackets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering could be then developed in the domain of material
engineering. Structural parts for pilot, crew and passenger seating were
developed and kept leadership by meeting and developing further safety
and certification requirements with authorities. The rest of the cabin
would then require similar technical capabilities for stress and
flammability constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All cabin interiors and galley’s area require qualification and
certification competencies to package for instance kitchen appliances to
airworthiness standards. All of which also requires to withstand severe
static and dynamic mechanical testing which are complex to monitor and
use for further design of assemblies and parts. Furthermore,
standardization is not common in this market because of market volumes
and changing demand of airlines looking for unique branding
opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;aircraft-systems&#34;&gt;Aircraft systems&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the $20^{th}$ century, the group continued to settle its
position in other fields of the aircraft equipment market. Monogram (MAG
Aerospace) and Groupe Intertechnique were acquired. They had
respectively developed themselves in the field of water &amp;amp; waste systems
engineering and embedded systems for aircraft operations (computer,
printed circuit boards, fuel gauging systems, oxygen masks and control
systems). These two first acquisitions were a key advantage to secure
market niches. Added value is accomplished through complex system
engineering, functional robustness and secured certification
capabilities for further product development. It was the occasion to
combine engineering competencies into the creation of a business unit in
the field of airbags for automotive industry with inflatable technical
fabric and precise control electronic systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, these activities would be complemented by several power
electronics generation and distribution (ECE, Zodiac Electrical Power
Systems), wiring parts/systems and hydraulic, servo-control and ducting
systems. The underlying SMEs acquired on such domains had been building
their field first through components and quickly grew into engineering
of sub-systems and full systems in order to cover regulation and
certification domain. Several breakthroughs can be mentioned such as
inerting systems for fuel tanks, oxygen regulators, or even metal
fabrication in harsh environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;todays-rt-and-innovation-an-oddity-for-innovation-management&#34;&gt;Today’s R&amp;amp;T and Innovation: an oddity for innovation management?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;zstc-and-experts-network&#34;&gt;ZSTC and Experts Network&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Established in 2010 by the managing director of former Intertechnique
group (covering former Aerotechnique group of activities, i.e. Fuel &amp;amp;
Control Systems and Oxygen Systems), the Zodiac Scientific and Technical
Council (ZSTC) gathers engineering managers and R&amp;amp;T managers equally
representing the variety of activities in the group. It was created for
four main objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepare technological evolution for the decade ahead and reinforce
synergies: long-term Technology Road Map were created to fit market
&amp;amp; sales perspectives to feed product lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value technical experts across the company: expert career path
created with Human Resources for engineers preferring a technical
career instead of one dedicated to management&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinforce relationships with academia, start-ups, innovative
suppliers and potential partners: incentives to host PhD candidates
in R&amp;amp;T departments, collaborative research programs, &lt;em&gt;TechnoDays&lt;/em&gt;
seminars to gather people around common topics (e.g. composite
materials, electronics, systems engineering, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinforce Intellectual Property protection and management, as well
as R&amp;amp;T management practice (guidelines and procedures)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council creation was supported by the Vice President of the group
(Maurice Pinault) for its strategic leverage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is a major leverage of growth for the Group such ours which designs
and manufacturers the most complex systems and that is required to meet
regulation constraints and quality &amp;amp; safety requirements increasingly
harder. In 2010, we created the ZSTC to improve the performance of our
technological research, to gather necessary resources for our
competitivity and foster the development of cross-cutting innovation
with high added value.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint effort contributed to encourage transversality through some
major disciplines for the group such as material flammability, power
electronics, systems engineering and composite material engineering and
manufacturing. &lt;em&gt;TechnoDays&lt;/em&gt; have been organized for these topics,
experts were nominated locally in business units, and through round of
interviews experts gain different status degrees of the career path:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;late-creation-of-rt-function-through-trl-assessment&#34;&gt;Late Creation of R&amp;amp;T function through TRL assessment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this initial background and internal efforts made in the business
units Zodiac Fuel &amp;amp; Control Systems to constitute a dedicated R&amp;amp;T Team
(in 2012-2013), workshops were organized with the support of a
consultancy firm to define and implement technology road maps (TRMs) for
all business units. With a bottom-up approach validated by top
management strategy, road maps were fed with marketing and sales data
picturing the future markets and technologies were identified to enable
and facilitate potential market access. Aircraft and equipment
manufacturers had been implementing the notion of Technology Readiness
Level (TRL) which streamlined the road-mapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidelines were subsequently written to support the rollout of this new
language and practice. Business units were then able to provide and use
a maturity assessment canvas for the technologies in development and the
road ahead for integration. The president of the ZSTC was then appointed
Chief Technical Officer (CTO) of the Zodiac Aerospace group, a new
position created by the CEO. His role consisted in gradually
institutionalizing the R&amp;amp;T function in business units, supporting them
for public funding opportunities and auditing the practice of R&amp;amp;T and
innovation management (TRL assessment, TRM, patent application and PhD
subjects).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-innovation-locus-where-exploration-project-management-and-organizational-design-clash&#34;&gt;An innovation locus where exploration project management and organizational design clash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we have portrayed in the previous pages the history of aircraft
engineering, the establishment of design rules and the acquisitions
strategy of Zodiac Aerospace. Several key features can be listed
characterizing the innovation context for Zodiac Aerospace (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An industrial ecosystem at stake with increasing uncertainties and
unknown due to strong segregated rigidities mirrored by engineering,
safety and regulations but facing potential radical transformations
of architecture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complexity and difficulty to master a full system (architecture and
components) - myopic behaviours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architectures defined in a contingent manner by the ecosystem
raising uncertainties and the unknown shifts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urge to innovate for strategic competitive advantage in the wake of
a radical change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A consolidated market made of conglomerate but without being
traditional divisional firms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autonomy and responsibility of individual SMEs but the necessity to
orchestrate their interdependencies to innovate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects situated in a intra-BU and inter-BU context challenging
product/service design and organizations simultaneously&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A light corporate team dedicated to innovation with several relay
networks (professions, experts)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zodiac Aerospace presents a distributed innovation management with an
ongoing standardization for processes (Quality Management System) and to
some extent structures (R&amp;amp;T department separated from Development
Engineering). Each BU has its own responsibility and dedicated financial
reporting. They all face their own market segment with the associated
professionalisation but also the urge to embrace uncertainties and the
unknown to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This situation encourages to understand the place in the (aircraft)
system architecture, the interfaces, the interdependencies and knowledge
yet to be discovered to guide exploration and consider synergies with
other BUs. It is a concern for top management as they worry about the
strategy of this portfolio of SMEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEO and VP&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; have stressed the idea the intent was to secure the
niches in the long run, but still develop their own capabilities to
prepare the future. They specified the importance of branch directors to
oversee the portfolio of business units to build a sustainable strategy
for them. Top management had for instance launched several initiatives
they considered to be key for the group or gave a place for bottom-up
projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, transversality was gradually being organized with
communities of experts, TechnoDays, (in)formal communities of practice
for engineering and R&amp;amp;T managers at the BU or division level.
Top management also decided to launch projects and places were novel
products and services could be developed &lt;em&gt;in-between&lt;/em&gt; the organizational
boundaries or just seen as strategic for the whole group. A fuel-cell
project was launched, hosted by a business unit with the prospect to
developing this technology for the aircraft equipment market with
perspectives on electricity, water and heat management. Two teams were
set near aircraft manufactures: one near Airbus and the other by Boeing.
These teams were composed of several engineers, designers and managers
from different business units. They dedicated 50% of their time to
technical support for their BU of origin; the rest was dedicated to
business intelligence and innovation management. Workshops, prototyping,
and presentations were regularly organized by the team to generate
concepts sometimes in partnership with clients, users and also
representatives of BUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gradual rationalization of the R&amp;amp;T and Innovation activities since
2010 with the establishment of R&amp;amp;T and Innovation management within each
BU was supplemented by an effort coordinated by top management to the
develop even more radical design of products and services. The former
tend to address incremental innovation, sometimes radical ones aimed
through a path punctuated by several steps to test their environment.
For instance, long term projects are part of partnership agreement
funded by institutions such as associative, national or international
Research Councils. The latter were a means for the Executive Committee
to protect existing niches from more radical concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these specific case raising strategic interest, such project were
addressed in a different &lt;em&gt;locus&lt;/em&gt; breaking away from the existing and
protected organization design: the multi-BU committee was rather
convenient. Otherwise, the Business Unit being is considered as an
indivisible unit. It encourages the development of alternative
approaches: fostering exploration topics, steering committees for
valuation and strategy, and project management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-studies-selection&#34;&gt;Case studies selection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;brief-case-description&#34;&gt;Brief case description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, we present the different case studies conducted at Zodiac
Aerospace and that where discussed in five different articles in
Appendix. Due to organizational dimension of innovation management of
this conglomerate of SMEs, and the organization design, we propose to
split the cases in two categories: intra-BU and inter-BU. The trajectory
of studied projects were, in fact, more or less contained within the
perimeter of a business unit, market segment,
qualification/certification requirements. Other cases were deliberately
set in between these boundaries or across with top management
sponsorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;intra-bu-cases&#34;&gt;Intra-BU cases&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;icing-conditions-detection&#34;&gt;Icing conditions detection&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first impulse originated in the early 90s with the concern a former
CEO - Intertechnique group (now Zodiac Fuel and Control Systems) - and
with the crash of an ATR72 in the U.S.A due to ice accretion on wings. A
project manager and engineer (who would eventually become the R&amp;amp;T
manager), developed an ultrasonic sensor for wing’s skin to detect ice
and measure icing-protection fluid dilution ratio. It allowed
participating to several test campaigns, to gain a reputation in the
field for safety and airworthiness (DGAC, EASA, Transport Canada), and
develop two versions of the technology with the support of funding
(SPAé, European Power Optimized Aircraft) and synergies with pending
product development (e.g. computer electronics for A380). A first patent
was applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early 2000s, the technology is compared in test campaigns with the
monopoly’s solution (Goodrich, former Richmond; mechanical oscillator).
It proved its efficiency on the ground but not for flying conditions due
to several technical limitations compared to competition’s: no defrost,
complex wing installation and high costs. Furthermore, Airbus did not
support the development as their aircraft (A380) is not sensitive to
icing. Airworthiness institutions were indeed specifying icing
conditions types and aircraft sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, regional aircraft manufacturers such as ATR and Bombardier were
pushing former Aerazur entity (now Zodiac Elastomer Europe) and
Intertechnique for an integrated ice detection and ice protection
system. With the support of several engineers recruited in previous
years, they developed a solution tested again with the support of Airbus
as the icing conditions detection regulations were evolving. Three test
campaigns were conducted with convincing results from an alternative
technology (thermodynamics and Peltier effect) overcoming the previous
limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite an aircraft program request for proposal and with uncertainty
and potential surprises in airworthiness evolutions, the recently
established icing conditions team at Intertechnique pivoted towards an
unfamiliar technology for the BU (laser optics). Parallel studies were
conducted, and the R&amp;amp;T manager had participated to technology
evaluations with FAA and Transport Canada. In addition, strategy and
business development managers had considered potential acquisitions to
definitely break the monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in 2011 a new project on uncertain laser technology was
launched within a CleanSky program. And more recently, a second project
was launched, with CleanSky2, forking the technology concept developed
so far and extending the airworthiness validity domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The researcher came around this case with the support of the
CTO and R&amp;amp;T manager who explicitly mentioned the need to specify the
nature of this projects at odds with other R&amp;amp;T and Engineering
Departments activities and with BU management. The project was seen as
an unidentified object despite having legitimacy in the airworthiness,
safety fields and among aircraft manufacturer engineering departments.
The generative processes needed to be further specified to understand
the nuances of its innovation potential of attraction with respect to
the engineering department, knowledge and organization design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;business-class-seat-platform&#34;&gt;Business Class Seat platform&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This case is an outcome of a recurrent topic at Zodiac Seats France:
standardization and modularization of seat architecture to facilitate
product development. Indeed, airlines demand for seats change every 5-10
years, including cabin reconfiguration for seasonal passengers flows,
and they request a short development cycle of about 2 years, compared to
the 10 years (approx.) for an aircraft. However, the seat is absolutely
critical in passenger safety with severe qualification and certification
requirements in association with increasing demands for
airline/passenger customization and ergonomic design. Despite the
beneficial prospects of platform engineering for economy and business
class seats, the rhythm of product development and complexity in
conjunction with optimized resources hadn’t left many opportunities to
develop such project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separated from development engineers, a recently constituted R&amp;amp;T
department was tasked to study the modularization of a business class
seat for easier packaging and certification. A large exploration
(patent, design options, architectures, technologies etc.) was
considered and selection of design concepts were made based on product
development criteria and support of several engineering, operations and
marketing stakeholders. Further stress simulation and testing was
required, but following the bid award from a demanding airline, the
subsequent design and development was driven by customer requirements
and its design studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several difficulties were discovered late in the development raising
questions on the maturity of the design and certification requirements
such as increased difficulties associated with the joint qualification
of seat and shell and inclusion of airbags. Delays were unfortunately
accumulated with numerous quality problems due to technical compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the exploration quality, exploitation issues had to be dealt
with. The project trajectory that aimed at developing a business class
seat platform was compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The research was introduced to such product development case
as he was supporting the R&amp;amp;T department in formalizing the TRL
assessment and associated management. The Director of Engineering and
R&amp;amp;T managers were intrigued and disturbed by the design choices and
integration issues, requesting a deeper understanding of the
coordination and collective action model, as well as how the innovation
potential of attraction of the platform was managed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;hypoxia-protection---researchers-intervention&#34;&gt;Hypoxia protection - researcher’s intervention&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The R&amp;amp;T department was preparing mid-2017 a participation to CleanSky2
program with Airbus as a partner in order to propose new radical
solution to protect pilots from hypoxia. The need emerged from the
necessity (safety) requiring a pilot to wear the emergency oxygen mask
when alone in the cockpit. Such requirement is however hardly compatible
with the required comfort of extended use due to emergency design of the
mask (high levels of stress, smoke in the cabin, emergency manoeuvre)..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team was originally constituted of R&amp;amp;T engineers, and then after 6
months, they were stretched over the traditional engineering department
dedicated to product development leaving only one R&amp;amp;T member. Numerous
brainstorming and design sessions with the support from an external
design studio contributed to a wide and in-depth exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel, an internal &amp;ldquo;Open Innovation Challenge&amp;rdquo; organized by the
ZSTC for which one of the two topics was improving ergonomics of the
oxygen crew mask. The researcher had then proposed a C-K mapping to
position and value the concepts proposed by ZA participants. In addition
to the acquaintance with the R&amp;amp;T and Engineering manager for other
purposes, the researcher was requested to support the project team in
selecting concepts, and guiding them before the first proposal to the
CleanSky2 partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the occasion to work on the decision-making and the design of
alternatives and states of nature, as well as embedding the organization
design required to support the innovation effort expected in the
project. The dichotomy of exploration/exploitation could then be
revisited and nuanced within this project. It enabled the proposal of
novel ways to organize collective action within and around the
exploration project.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;inter-bu-cases&#34;&gt;Inter-BU cases&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;airbus-development-team---design-thinking-cases&#34;&gt;Airbus Development Team - Design Thinking cases&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ADT is sponsored and monitored by the C-suite for strategic
management purposes. The team was tasked to provide technical support
for several BUs and to generate concepts that would feed on unmet user
needs by gaining a better knowledge of real use cases of ZA products.
The team is constituted of 8 permanent engineers and designers delegated
by BUs for three years maximum, and dedicating half of their time to
their BU’s sales/technical support. They report to a local manager who
actively contributes to the team creative effort and facilitates
discussions with BUs. He reports to the group VP of Strategy and
Business Development as well as the Chief Technical Officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Design Thinking (DT) methodology was chosen to promote the
user-centric approach, explore usage, share gathered knowledge, and
ideate for and with relevant BUs. ADT’s two project leaders were trained
to DT at Stanford’s d.school, and other members were trained in other
institutions. A design and creativity spirit was largely promoted by the
local manager as well as the members themselves. The projects phasing
completely covered DT’s enactment themes (Carlgren, Rauth, and Elmquist
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Carlgren2016a&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both cases addressed transverse topics where many BUs are concerned in
some way or are actively part of the value chain. The first topic dealt
with waste managed onboard aircrafts. The second topic tackled the
optimization of aircraft turn around time (i.e. between landing and
take-off). Several users and extreme users can be searched and studied
to build empathy and also the technical/market knowledge from the
different BUs is tightly interfaced around both topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to fit the scope of work of the ADT, the team shared knowledge
with BUs to keep them up-to-date and build legitimacy all along the DT
process. A “Multi BU workshop” was organized for problem-reframing and
further ideation and prototyping with BUs. A final selection process was
defined based on DT criteria and ZA’s strategic intent: customer value,
technical feasibility, passenger experience, group strategic alignment,
in addition to a separate ranking for “creative sparks”. The selected
concepts were then approved by the Group VP of Strategy. Thereafter,
they were shared again and promoted to business units who could
potentially host their development in their renewed product lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; the researcher had first visited ADT in Toulouse, since it was
recognized as one of the new loci of innovation in ZA. Interested by the
PhD project and with several pending problems regarding concept
appropriation by BU, the local manager accepted and invited his
colleagues to provide relevant project documentation and interviews to
gain an understanding of the projects driven by Design Thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lower-deck&#34;&gt;Lower deck&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As several projects had been launched as well as numerous ideation
sessions at ADT, the researcher had presented his analysis of the two
Design Thinking cases in March 2016. Among the conclusions, the C-K
mapping and project trajectories had revealed the recurrent topic of
using the aircraft lower deck (cargo area) as a means to embody several
concepts enabling solutions for waste management and aircraft turn
around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local manager had also a hunch for such topic as it had been quite
recurrent in the three years of existence of ADT, including a
provisional patent application with a former intern. As the team was
about to be renewed, he decided to request the former intern to come
back and support a new project dedicated to the lower deck use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first market study was launched with a consulting firm to evaluate
airline’s ticket yield management in addition to fleet evolution and
maintenance dates, to envision the size of lower deck market in addition
to its integration. The latter was critical as it implied modifying the
aircraft’s cargo area for passengers without disrupting airlines’
operations. The technical feasibility of this retrofit was studied first
by an external engineering firm and then deepen by an internal BU
dedicated to certifying specific aircraft customization. In parallel,
concepts were tested with several airlines’ executives, and the overall
business case was discussed with ZA Executive Committee board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project proved to be a success as several key client (airlines and
Airbus) formalized requests for proposals and project development
framing is ongoing (see announcements during last Aircraft Interiors
Exposition in Hamburg 2018). Moreover, several BUs are willing to take
ownership of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This project has to be read at the light of the Design
Thinking projects conducted at ADT and other projects followed by
closely by the ExCom.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;connected-cabin&#34;&gt;Connected Cabin&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The raising interest for connectivity and Big Data for aviation industry
had made its way into Zodiac Aerospace. Such topic was a perfect fit for
Zodiac Inflight Innovations who developed inflight entertainment
solutions and communication devices as well as Zodiac Data Systems
(antennae and inflight test equipment). The topic was rather convenient
for another BU such as Zodiac Air Catering Equipment whose market value
chain extends from the aircraft galley area to catering services
delivering the trolleys to aircraft doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two members of the ZSTC, affiliated to Zodiac Inflight Innovations
started pitching the idea in front of the Executive Committee to launch
a project on Big Data services centred around an enhanced cabin with
connectivity hardware enabling machine to machine communication and
management. After two rounds with the support from a member of the ExCom
in charge of their business branch, they managed to precise the project
scope, potential business case, and needed resource to develop a
prototype to probe the market at 2017 Aircraft Interiors Exposition in
Hamburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team was constituted with engineers from different BUs providing
equipment for the cabin and who had an interest in constituting the
connected cabin and developing associated services. The project moved on
quickly with bi-weekly reporting meetings followed by the VP of Strategy
and Business Development, and numerous side meetings. Moreover, the
ExCom made an open statement to investors that a project was being
launched to value aircraft connectivity. A cabin prototype was
manufactured with built-in connectivity features and scenarized for
airlines. It put forward the benefits of retrofitting hardware and
software providing value-added services smoothing airline operations and
client experience and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prototype enabled collecting valuable feedback from potential
clients and following the exposition the project did not continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The researcher came around this case as he knew the two ZSTC
members and regularly attended ExCom meetings relative to technology and
innovation. They were keen on having him following the progress of the
project and keep track of concepts generated along, even before the
budgeting agreed by ExCom. This case benefited from the same context and
sponsorship as the Lower deck. Consequently, we can contrast them and
nuance their respective innovation potential of attraction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;multi-bu-committee&#34;&gt;Multi-BU committee&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The researcher was regularly invited by the CTO to attend
ExCom meetings relative to technology and innovation. These meetings
were usually labelled Multi-BU meetings following the interest of former
CEO (Olivier Zarrouati) to have a top-down approach urging new projects
(such as the Fuel Cell briefly exposed earlier) and also to offer space
to projects originating in one or multiple BUs bearing a strategic
importance. All of these projects addressed new markets, gaps in between
market segments by bringing forward new technologies or new product
concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case is approached not necessarily on the technical, engineering or
marketing content of the projects steered by the MBU committee, but
rather on the way decision-making was conducted by individuals and teams
attending these meetings. ExCom members were all present with leadership
from the CEO and VP of Business Development and Strategy. The meetings
were prepared by the MBU Director, also called Director of Large
Projects (&lt;em&gt;Directeur des Grands Projets&lt;/em&gt;) with the support of the
Director in charge of product roadmaps. The job involved monthly
reporting of the projects to the mentioned VP as they would be
subsidized by top management budget (stemming from fees collected by the
holding on BUs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meetings occurred in average every quarter, sometimes punctuated by
other meetings in between for projects requiring an urgent strategic
decision: commercial support for business development, group strategy
relative to overall market positioning and budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Committee operates as an alternative locus of (radical) innovation
compared to in-house R&amp;amp;T and Product Development activities in BUs. It
emphasizes the interest of corporate management for entrepreneurship
across the group. It also differs from the ZSTC and members of the
Innovation Direction whose role leans towards support (processes and
tools) and networking for knowledge domains sustained by experts.&lt;/p&gt;

Design Theories are used to track generativity of the design practice: user fixation and learning metabolism supporting innovation management. &lt;br&gt; Presented at 6th Creativity Innovation Management (CIM) Community Workshop, first submitted and rejected Spring 2017 to CIM Journal, reformulated for R&amp;amp;D Management Conference 2018 and resubmitted to CIM journal with substantial modifications compared to first version.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision-making in exploration project management&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article directly submitted to CERN IdeaSquare Journal of Experimental Innovation (2017), after a round of reviews for ICED 2017, we presented an exploration project conducted over more than a decade. It showcases the project’s timeline and what could be considered as an irrational due to a preference reversal. &lt;br&gt;We propose instead to extend the notion of rationality with the existence of generative actions and the deliberate will to reverse preferences. These are seen as means to manage the unknown. Departing from optimization, design and generative processes can support this extension and exploration. We consequently introduce the notion &lt;em&gt;decisional ambidexterity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organizational Ambidexterity and innovation management&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;This paper addresses the hypothesis that organizational ambidexterity (OA) can kill innovation. The first version called for the importance of decision-making to understand the operationalization of OA as mentioned by researchers in the field. We propose to leverage non-expected utility decision-making based on Paper 2, but in reality with the feedback from the research community we also recentred the presentation on problem-solving as originally discussed by James March seminal paper (March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;). We stress the aporia of segregating exploration from exploitation for a meaningful exploration as generativity is otherwise biased and reduced. The latter revealed being crucial to manage the unknown and consequently to innovate. &lt;br&gt;Presented at EURAM 2018 Conference Innovation SIG and will be rewritten based on valuable collected feedback.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designing decision: managing the unknown&lt;/strong&gt; This article discusses the need to overcome the decision paradigm by embracing design theories to extend the latter to the unknown. Four archetypes of decisions based on design paths are presented corresponding to different forms of collective action: learning, performance and organization. Compared to the published paper, we extend the model with organizational theories by integrating organizational constraints and hypothesis in the decision design reasoning to generate and execute alternatives/decisions to be managed in exploration/exploitation modes. &lt;br&gt;Presented on several occasions by Pascal Le Masson, debated with the researcher over the PhD’s second year. After a first round of reviews, a modified version is in press in the European Management Review.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambidextrous decisions and corporate entrepreneurship&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Given the anomaly and the proposed model, we will present two cases that can explain their success and failure. These have a corporate entrepreneurship taste and present features relating to decisional ambidexterity, managing the unknown and organizing for it. One case appears to have the right set of practices to succeed in its innovative design and associated management whereas the other one struggles. The comparison allows justifying the usefulness of the new model and ways to implement certain practices. It is a working paper to be submitted by the end of 2018 to conferences (to be determined)&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After having globally presented the general research methodology of the
PhD journey for the research questions refined over the last three
years, we have described in this chapter the actual research context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of the aviation industry, its emergence, and its gradual
organization and segmentation with the numerous original actors explain
the dynamics of today’s market and positioning of players such as Zodiac
Aerospace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This firm has developed specific innovation capabilities through several
decades of acquisitions, extending its market footprint. In the last
decade, we presented how centralization and gradual homogenization, new
coordination means and collective action patterns emerged to cope with
the unknown to be managed for future aircraft programs and markets. We
exposed also the difficulties for top/middle/local management to address
the challenges imposed by exploration project management with respect to
the underlying organization designs and market segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we introduced the case studies conducted at Zodiac Aerospace
and how these led to published and presented articles in journals and
conferences. These papers fit with the methodology of anomaly detection,
theoretical modelling and empirical testing. We explain how the other
cases support the researcher’s intervention, testing and
experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: The reader should not consider that there are different
levels of criticality but rather that in order to ease the
development, qualification and certification, some equipment are not
necessarily queued in the qualification process of the aircraft but
as interdependencies are mastered in the integrating aircrafts the
certification process can be carried &amp;ldquo;separately&amp;rdquo; even though
several features are still adjusted through changes
requested/submitted between manufacturer and supplier. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

outlined as a comparison (Hölzle

formalized by Human Resources. Several cross-overs would occur
between programs and traditional management. The projectification of

      <title>Chapter 6 - Results</title>
      <link>https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part3/chapter6/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part3/chapter6/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this first batch of results, we task ourselves to demonstrate an
anomaly in the presented case studies by opposition to the literature
models in our  
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part1/chapter3/&#34;&gt;research questions chapter&lt;/a&gt;,
p.). The results are presented in the same fashion for the three
selected case studies. They are also detailed in different articles in
the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/&#34;&gt;publications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systematically, we present the trajectory of the project where we stress
what appears to be a &lt;em&gt;weak signal&lt;/em&gt; with respect to generative processes
at stake. It appears as an obstacle for collective action, something
that has created a management issue for involved designers, engineers
and managers. We then propose to use the &lt;strong&gt;adaptive, interactive and
encapsulated&lt;/strong&gt; models to &lt;strong&gt;predict&lt;/strong&gt; what could have been the course of
action. It will serve as a reference point for the actual course of
action and detect the anomaly with more precision as explained in the

&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter4/&#34;&gt;methodology section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We first present the analysis of the &lt;em&gt;Icing conditions detection&lt;/em&gt; case
(see description, p.). It reveals what could be considered as absurd or
even irrational decision-making as depicted in (Le Glatin, Le Masson,
and Weil &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeGlatin2017a&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeGlatin2017a&#34;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeGlatin2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeGlatin2017&#34;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;), can be accessed in the
appendix (). The product ends up in a paradoxical tension between the
developed technology, its legitimacy and the organizational anchoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we present another case of platform engineering exploration for
aircraft seat design: &lt;em&gt;Business Class Seat platform&lt;/em&gt; (see description,
p.), which has been analysed in (Le Glatin, Le Masson, and Weil
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeGlatin2018a&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;) and that can be accessed in the appendix
(p.). The trajectory reveals a transitioning for exploration to
exploitation regime with several difficulties questioning the efficiency
of both exploration and exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third and finally, we analyse &lt;em&gt;Airbus Development Team - Design
Thinking&lt;/em&gt; cases (see description, p.). The &lt;em&gt;performance nature&lt;/em&gt; of
generative processes is at the heart of this case as discussed in (Le
Glatin et al. &lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeGlatin2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;; Le Glatin, Le Masson, and Weil
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeGlatin2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;) and that can be accessed in the appendix
(p.). Again organizational ambidexterity is challenged by specificities
of generativity causing several complications to enable a sustainable
innovation management.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;icing-conditions-misunderstood-entrepreneur-or-absurdity&#34;&gt;Icing conditions: misunderstood entrepreneur or absurdity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;trajectory-of-the-project&#34;&gt;Trajectory of the project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As described previously in the methodology sections (see p.), the case
was suggested to the researcher for analysis as the R&amp;amp;T manager had
managed the project from the beginning and had increasing pressure on
the conditions of exploitation after the years of exploration and
financial constraints to continue exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure.&lt;a href=&#34;#fig:IcingTraj&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;fig:IcingTraj&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;
below, gives the chronology of the project as it was developed over more
than two decades. The sequence can be followed through the numbers at
the corner of several boxes and years highlighted at the bottom. The
arrows indicate sequence and causality operating for actions, decisions
and the design of decisions. It is, of course, a condensed view of the
history of the project but we can stress the nature of exploration
(disrupt monopoly), when exploitation (client request and market
opportunity) could have occurred and when exploration was launched
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vertical dotted line is the critical part in the project trajectory.
A first exploration was carried out by the project team looking for
alternative solution overcoming limitations known of the monopoly’s
solution. They scouted the field, several test campaigns were conducted
with the support of national laboratories and aircraft manufacturers.
These were proven successful despite some caveats as the first
technology developed addressed only ice detection on ground. However,
another solution was developed with further test campaigns. Regional
aircraft manufacturers were looking for an alternative solution to the
monopoly and possibly for an integrated system: detection and protection
from ice. Restrictions were looming over regional aircrafts as they were
statistically known more sensitive to icing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, instead of going for this aircraft program and
system/product development between ZFCS and ZEEU that was at hand’s
reach, the current technology development were stopped altogether.
Exploitation promises were discarded, in order to launch a new wave of
exploration addressing yet to be specified icing conditions: new
undefined regulations, scientific knowledge on icing conditions, and
appropriate technology. We propose then to zoom on this key moment of
the project history that balances exploration and exploitation in order
to make sense of it through the lens of literature models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;models-predictions&#34;&gt;Models’ predictions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to 1.08&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model of coordination and collective action&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; BU management and
group top management were involved in key decisions (search direction
for technology development, patenting, business acquisition, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: BU management could have selected the program
opportunity with the development of the system between ZFCS and ZEEU as
a means to set a first foot on the monopoly for future learning promises
in the new environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generative processes&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The exploration was rich in finding existing
alternatives but generating new ones that are undecidable is not
considered by adaptive models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: The exploration movement should have been gradually
adapted to fit exploitation constraints. Make or Buy strategy for the
detection technology (e.g. acquire Vibrometer firm) in order to bring
value added with an integrated system (detection and protection) by
opposition to a standalone solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment cognition&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; Interactions were created with laboratories,
test facilities and potential clients to guide the search direction:
overcome limitations of monopoly’s solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: Wait for the environment to stabilize and prescribe new
requirements on icing conditions regulations, which can make the
generated concepts decidable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization design&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; R&amp;amp;T team dedicated to exploration, spatially
isolated from engineering department. It was identified as a new
standalone product line. The development engineering was familiar with
systems engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: The exploitation could have been conducted for the icing
conditions detection and protection system between ZFCS and ZEEU.
Resources were available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to 1.08&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model of coordination and collective action&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; R&amp;amp;T engineers and
managers created and made sense of the surveyed technologies. Meetings
were organized with middle and top management to structure future course
of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: Middle and top management allow and enable further
interactions to gain awareness and act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generative processes&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; Test campaigns, studies and meetings were
conducted and shared among engineers and managers. Presentations are
held with management to envision new positioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: The appropriate sense and knowledge could have
eventually captured through subsequent interactions. R&amp;amp;T manager could
have then refined the new meaning emerging from further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment cognition&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; Numerous interactions with clients,
laboratories and potential clients were conducted to address
uncertainties of icing conditions and required technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: Shape new networks, lead-users and unknown interpreters
to gradually design new technologies for icing conditions. Continue
developing open innovation practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization design&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The exploration team had expanded beyond the
ZFCS boundaries and gradually gaining recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: This open innovation should have easily shaped a fully
autonomous product line as the legitimation process is carried out.
Perhaps even a new BU (ad-hoc) could be created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to 1.08&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model of coordination and collective action&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The exploration was
seen as sequenced projects probing alternatives’ validity and success.
The overall icing condition detection theme could be considered as a
program but without the management structure, despite having a
governance with middle and top management sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: Road-mapping activities to pave the way for future
projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generative processes&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; Each specific project encapsulated design and
engineering practices to refine the selected alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: These trial-and-error projects proving the technology,
regulation and market landscape should continue until an appropriate fit
is crystallized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment cognition&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; Each project engaged with clients and test
facilities, and they allowed building upon each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: Each project will explore the environment in a given
direction and contribute to future projects. For instance, the program
could have enforced the exploitation opportunity to sustain further
exploration on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization design&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The projects relied on R&amp;amp;T engineers and
request additional resources if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: Transferring the project to the development engineering
to develop the integrated system would have been possible due to system
related knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;anomaly-market-legitimacy-for-the-market-but-no-organizational-support&#34;&gt;Anomaly: market legitimacy for the market but no organizational support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to 1.08&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model of coordination and collective action&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The team conducting
exploration didn’t support the exploitation opportunity but rather
continued exploration. They handed over some R&amp;amp;T engineers to develop
&amp;ldquo;on the shelf&amp;rdquo; the first version of the explored product, whilst further
exploration continued shaping the unknown (norms and regulations, and
aircraft integration and safety)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generative processes&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The exploration was guided by a future
prospect of exploitation: safety norm evolution and associated icing
conditions typologies. They willingly reversed preferences by choosing a
highly uncertain technology, but managing the environment legitimacy in
parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment cognition&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The environment is shaped by the R&amp;amp;T manager
constituting a collective path for the market: deciding regulation’s
scope and application, steering scientific discoveries and applied
research on icing conditions, and specifying norm and technological
performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization design&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The projects managed by the R&amp;amp;T team were
rather autonomous with partnerships and funding agreements. They gained
autonomy up to a point where developing a product required to hand over
some R&amp;amp;T engineers to the Product Development department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What our descriptors reveal is that the conducted project does partially
fit some of the models with an emphasis on the interactive and
encapsulated models. The team engaged with the environment’s actors and
pushed the trial-and-error pattern to ensure the legitimation of the
developed technology as well as the primacy/leadership of the newly
reconfigured icing conditions detection market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we see that the exploration is guided by exploitation
constraints that still requires to be fully settled and designed. The
project is at odds with organization design as they have evolved in
autonomy and developed capabilities so far unmatched by legacy
engineering departments. Top management, despite having sponsored the
exploration, still tries to keep the BU &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt; and avoids having a
spin-off. As the technology is not fully mandatory for existing
heavy-body aircraft (statistically proven by manufacturers), it still
requires to make a case for itself beyond small/regional aircraft
market. The BU strategy is thus challenged by this market re-orientation
and the lack of technology-market fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;lone-irrational-entrepreneur&#34;&gt;Lone irrational entrepreneur?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could argue the R&amp;amp;T manager used foolishness (March

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;) to refuse the first exploitation opportunity
benefiting from synergies with another BU. He is however a sane spirit
in a sane body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adaptation of technology is performed dynamically with the
environment being shaped by managing safety regulation and norms as well
as technology legitimation. Exploration of technologies and product
concept are guided by generating and refining alternatives of what
exploitation (regulation and standard) could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The non-mutual conditioning of the regimes is compromised, but brings
new hopes for exploitation. As discussed in (Le Glatin, Le Masson, and
Weil 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeGlatin2017a&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeGlatin2017a&#34;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;, see 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/pub-leglatin2017a/&#34;&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt;), preferences were reversed, representing a violation of rational theory
of choice, but at the same time allowed uncovering prospective
alternatives requiring a contingent environment management.
This entrepreneurial effort is not isolated, it was sustained through a
rich engagement with the environment, learning for the R&amp;amp;T team, but
also support from BU management and top management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;new-bu-for-zssm&#34;&gt;New BU for ZSSM?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This offshoot generated by the R&amp;amp;T team dedicated to icing conditions
detection was established as a young product line. The issue for top
management is the absence of a clearly defined market for heavy-body
aircraft, which are the &lt;em&gt;norm&lt;/em&gt; for other products in the BU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is probably the paradox of this exploration project and the autonomy
gained through open innovation practice, path constitution and funding
schemes. It is abnormal for the three models, as the top management
sponsored the emergent strategy from the beginning, and steered the
process along the way as a strong technological advantage could be
developed to overcome the monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, exploitation is shifted from its standard belief and
conception to market the product, from a marketing and engineering
standpoint. In fact, the prototype developed and tested by R&amp;amp;T implies a
lot of rework for development engineering, in terms of robustness,
quality and manufacturing engineering. Nevertheless, the prototype can
also be seen as a means to support learning of the new technology so far
unfamiliar to the engineering department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a new BU appeared out of the equation. BU management preferred
to capitalize on the exploration and develop the new technology on the
shelf. They also allowed with external funding to let the new technology
version to be further explored as the norms and regulations being
co-managed by the R&amp;amp;T manager have created new slots requiring applied
research and product development to ensure aircraft safety and
airworthiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-seat-platform-poor-exploration-management&#34;&gt;A seat platform: poor exploration management?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;trajectory-of-the-project-1&#34;&gt;Trajectory of the project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As described previously in the case presentation (see p.), the
researcher was encouraged to have a closer look to this seat design
after we had organized several meetings and workshops to support the BU
in implementing their own management tools and practice to evaluate TRL
for R&amp;amp;T projects and support handovers with Development Engineering.
This Business Class seat platform project, not only raised the
assessment issue for isolated technologies and its integration, but
rather emphasised the criticality of design robustness as a system to
meet requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure
&lt;a href=&#34;#fig:BCTraj&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;fig:BCTraj&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;
below, gives the chronology of the project as it was developed over more
than two years. The sequence can be followed through the numbers at the
corner of several boxes and years highlighted at the bottom. The arrows
indicate sequence and causality operating for actions, decisions and the
design of decisions. It is a condensed view of the history of the
project but we can stress the nature of exploration (platform envelop
definition and selection) and the shift towards exploitation requested
by a demanding client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vertical dotted line is the critical part in the project trajectory.
A first exploration was carried out by the project team looking for
alternative solution overcoming limitations of packaging and
certification for business class (BC) seat. Several options were found
in the market (patents, competition benchmark) and they designed several
alternatives before elaborating criteria with BU stakeholders to decide
on the concept. They ended up with a seat architecture sharing a frame
with neighbouring seat (like a bench) supporting their own load and a
shell providing volume and several valuable BC features. The modular
design puts the emphasis on the seat lower frame as being the core on
which all other modules would plug in (foot rest, backrest, shell,
etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when sales and program management teams saw the attractivity of
the product with a greater living space which seduced a demanding
client. The concept design was then selected by the client and further
refined with their own design studio. However, this shift from
exploration to exploitation revealed several complications in the design
architecture. For instance, the 3 legged seat and the load of both seat
and shell packaged together as whole for certification (i.e. airworthy
and safe for passenger) raised the mechanical engineering complexity.
This a priori successful balance from exploration to exploitation came
out to be quite disastrous: quality issues, delays, engineering cost
overruns, and jeopardized seat platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;models-predictions-1&#34;&gt;Models’ predictions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to 1.08&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model of coordination and collective action&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; Sales, Engineering and
Strategy managers took part in balancing out exploration and
exploitation effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: Management would actually encourage exploitation of the
explored alternatives and subsequent decision-making (concept selection
process )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generative processes&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The exploration was rich in finding and
generating alternatives, ensuring enough room for engineering to develop
a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: Once the concept is selected, the uncertainty reduction
mindset of development projects would be applied to meet client
requirements and product early-specifications (modularity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment cognition&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The technology and patent scouting was rich
and allowed finding &lt;em&gt;white spaces&lt;/em&gt; to develop new solutions. Known
issues for packaging, aircraft integration and certification-ease were
used to design alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: Once a client can make a demand fitting existing offer
(preliminary design), the exploitation should be launched and further
development would be based on adapting the course of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization design&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; R&amp;amp;T team dedicated to exploration and isolated
from engineering department. They were tasked to create a new product
concept based on modularity and new requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: When exploitation requirements are given, the project
should transfer its resources to development engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to 1.08&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model of coordination and collective action&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; R&amp;amp;T engineers and
manager designed digital mock-ups, coordinated with stakeholders to
select concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: Middle and top management pushes the mock-up and
prototypes among department to learn by doing and meet requirements
along the development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generative processes&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; Tests, simulations and meetings were held
around digital mock-ups to refine and generate choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: The mutual interactions between individuals and
prototypes during presentations, and client meetings will gradually
ensure a smooth uncertainty reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment cognition&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; Demonstrated awareness and scouting of the
environment through presentations and consultations with BU stakeholders
(engineering, marketing, packaging, certification).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: Added requirements will be identified through
interactions with client and prescribers (design studio). In exchange,
the proposed seat platform features will be discussed and mutually
adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization design&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The initial R&amp;amp;T project spreads beyond the R&amp;amp;T
team boundaries with involvement and consultation of different
stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: Depending on the evolution and definition of
requirements, the necessary resources will be found and support the
product design. The Engineering department may have to be reconfigured
to fit the modular design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to 1.08&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model of coordination and collective action&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The exploration
project had a concern for platform engineering feasibility and an
exploitation target (packaging, ease certification). Middle management
as well as BU management supported the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: The project would be part of a product line or stream of
projects, and eventually a program for business class seat platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generative processes&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The design practice to define the seat
platform made an effort to define the minimum and common features
required for modularity. The selection criteria also shaped the design
of alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: As new requirements would be demanded by the client, the
project would gradually adapt and propose variations to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment cognition&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The project reached out for unmet needs from
value chain and aircraft integration to extend the project’s
requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: The client’s project would define new requirements and
induce constraints that would have to be adjusted to the R&amp;amp;T project’s
specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization design&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The projects relied on R&amp;amp;T engineers and
request additional resources if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: Transferring the project to the development engineering
to develop the seat platform would require to temporarily find resources
in engineering departments to solve conflicting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;anomaly-a-rich-exploration-jeopardized-by-a-demanding-client&#34;&gt;Anomaly: a rich exploration jeopardized by a demanding client&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to 1.08&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model of coordination and collective action&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The exploration is
guided by exploitation objectives. The shift is capitalized by the
client and its requirement. During the actual product development,
mechanical engineering issues were faced due to novelty/unfamiliarity of
the product for development engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generative processes&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; Careful exploration was conducted with
criteria for selecting them defined with BU stakeholders. The
complications faced by exploitation activities raise numerous questions
on the evaluation of generated/selected alternatives. In the end, the
platform design is no longer modular and the client’s product becomes
specific and has generated cost overruns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment cognition&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; After exploring the environment to define
the platform, the client and its design studio imposed requirements
forcing the platform design to be adapted. The built-up awareness for
exploration is reduced and non-negotiated with the client (imposed
requirements).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization design&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The project gradually moved from R&amp;amp;T to
Engineering, but also had to come back to some R&amp;amp;T engineers to solve
complications in mechanical engineering practice. The Engineering
Department struggled to meet requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comparison shows that the actual course of action is far more
complex and raises again numerous obstacles the literature models would
not have fully grasped. For instance, the decision-making process
organized during the exploration phase was used not only to select a
platform design, but also as a basis to generate new alternatives in
between decision meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition from exploration to exploitation was seen from the angle
of the client who identified a feature (increased living space and leg
space) in the platform seat (with its enhanced packaging and
certification). However, the difficulties were treated by the
Engineering department requiring to call back R&amp;amp;T engineer to support
them. There is then an overlap of the influences between exploration and
exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;lack-robust-design-practice-between-rt-and-development&#34;&gt;Lack robust design practice between R&amp;amp;T and Development?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could argue that the engineering is overall of poor quality. It is
an argument hard to sustain as the BU is one of the market leaders and
pioneered several designs. Moreover, the product development is
conducted in short time period (2 years approximately) and it requires a
lot of flexibility within engineering departments to support the design
and development. The researcher had the occasion on multiple occasions
to witness the density of relationships and knowledge sharing within a
project’s scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with the Engineering Director, ex-post reviews were conducted
to evaluate the maturity and robustness of the design during the
exploitation phase (client’s program gates). It revealed that the
several mechanical issues relating to the interference of the platform
design and client requirements were understood late in the development
process. The researcher found that traditional product development (i.e.
no modularity) relies a lot on the physical testing conducted quite late
in the process due to parts availability&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, simulation test
engineers had flagged several flaws of the design, but were not heard by
development engineering preferring to witness the physical test, whereas
they were by R&amp;amp;T engineers during the exploration phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is not a complete failure as teachings have been transferred
to R&amp;amp;T team and advanced concept team (group of internal designers and
engineers) to study again the possibility to develop a new modular
design, with more emphasis on the shell design. Another topic on
modularity was also launched by the R&amp;amp;T team approaching the concept
differently, for instance, not in seat-centric way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;too-early-explorationexploitation-transition&#34;&gt;Too early exploration/exploitation transition?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could also argue the project was handed over to quickly to the
engineering department. However, it is not really the case as the
selection of concepts was made collectively and interactively with BU
stakeholder. The client’s request for proposal and bid award was an
actual great opportunity to value the exploration phase conducted by the
R&amp;amp;T team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is perhaps missing is the weakness in countering the demanding
client’s request which have pushed the physical limits of the platform
design. Why not using the client’s opportunity and constraints to
develop in parallel a full platform design instead of trying to keep
some complicated associated features (e.g. totally new compact seat
kinematic)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exploration and exploitation were put on a same continuum, being
perhaps overlapped at the beginning of the project. Later, it
unfortunately over-complexified the product design and development, to a
point where the innovation effort in the platform design is killed by
switching to a normalized exploitation regime. When discussing with
engineers and managers why some alternatives had been discarded
(designed by the researcher with C-K Theory, see (Le Glatin, Le Masson,
and Weil 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeGlatin2018a&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, see 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/pub-leglatin2018a/&#34;&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt;),
signs of regret were identified explaining the difficulty to identify
and articulate the exploration/exploitation divide earlier in design
practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adtdesign-thinking-resistance-death-valley-and-organizational-misfit-by-design&#34;&gt;ADT/Design Thinking: resistance, death valley and organizational misfit by design?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;trajectory-of-the-project-2&#34;&gt;Trajectory of the project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last case we are presenting here is the synthesis of two projects
managed by the Airbus Development Team (see p.). The researcher had the
occasion to analyse two projects led by two different members (engineer
and designer) who had been trained to Design Thinking. The other ADT
participants had been also introduced, if not trained to it, like it was
the case of ADT’s manager. The latter had given access to all
documentation available on their server and requested his colleagues to
save some time for my interviews. The team had been tasked to generate
proposals valuing BU’s know-how and combined synergies in the form of
Multi-BU projects. They usually referred to the recurrent argument of
the &lt;em&gt;not-invented here syndrome&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;resistance to change&lt;/em&gt; to explain
the absence of follow-up by BUs to develop their generated concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they stressed some cases where BUs were thrilled by having
opened their eyes to the competencies of sister BUs in the group,
unlocking interdependencies between products that are usually hidden by
market segmentation and sales channels. The projects based on Design
Thinking adapted the method to have BUs not only learn from user
knowledge, but also to have multi-BU design workshops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As presented in the Appendix
&lt;a href=&#34;#chap:paper1&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;chap:paper1&#34;&gt;[chap:paper1]&lt;/a&gt;
(p.), the cases were analysed with the help of C-K design theory in
order to understand the performance of the generative processes in the
projects and their impact for BUs (ADT’s mission). The C-K mappings were
synthesized from control groups of students from Mines ParisTech. The
figure
&lt;a href=&#34;#fig:ADTTraj&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;fig:ADTTraj&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;
below shows the synthesis of the projects’ trajectory. Both design
briefs (Better Waste Management and Turn Around Time Optimization)
followed the same pattern as they had defined a methodology canvas
adapted from their practice, experience and Design Thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our focus is on the output of the projects as they come to a standstill.
If Design Thinking may not be the key to everything, it is worth
understanding the relationship between the nature of generative
processes and their organization impact: concept appropriation and
development by business units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the appendix
&lt;a href=&#34;#chap:paper3&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;chap:paper3&#34;&gt;[chap:paper3]&lt;/a&gt;
(p.), this transition from exploration to an absence of exploitation is
analysed. Below, we propose rephrasing it with descriptors and models’
predictions derived from our literature review. The trajectory is
summarized in figure
&lt;a href=&#34;#fig:ADTTraj&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;fig:ADTTraj&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;,
and they strech over less than a year (approximately 8 months).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;ADTTraj.png&#34; id=&#34;fig:ADTTraj&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A constituted path challenging BU strategy and organization ties&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;models-predictions-2&#34;&gt;Models’ predictions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to 1.08&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model of coordination and collective action&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; ADT manager leaded the
balancing of exploration and exploitation prospects (BU’s interests).
Sponsorship from the VP of Business Development &amp;amp; Strategy. Workshops
were organized to balance out concepts and their rework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: Leadership and top management identifies how the
concepts can fit BUs’ strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generative processes&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The exploration was supported by Design
Thinking generative power driven by user empathy and extreme user cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: As user/client value is supported by Design Thinking
practice, the product development (exploitation) should naturally
occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment cognition&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The environment and value chain was scouted
with the help of Design Thinking and other ADT’s activities such as
previous projects and technical support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: The newly explored environment should ensure enough
decisional/problem-solving background for BUs to engage in exploitation
of concept proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization design&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; ADT team is an example of contextual
ambidexterity organized at the group level. The exploration is
delocalized, interactions with relevant BUs are maintained along the
exploration process (for organizational learning).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: Exploitation of proposed concepts will be slightly
adapted to the products design as they may require contractual
development between BUs. Organization design should mirror the product
as they have accepted and participated to the concepts’ user/client
value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to 1.08&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model of coordination and collective action&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; ADT members and BUs
correspondents, at stake with project’s topic, are in continuous contact
to share knowledge and co-design concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: Middle management should naturally embrace the concepts
as meaning is created and circulated. Top management will sponsor the
initiative due to emergent strategic interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generative processes&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; Users and observation studies provided the
foundations to generate concepts and solve existing or non-existing
issues creating justified value-added. Co-design sessions with BUs also
contributed to it in addition to knowledge sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: The gradual sense-making and demonstrated client value
should ensure concept appropriation and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment cognition&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; BUs’ environment knowledge was integrated as
well as extended by scouting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: The explored environment with new conceptual
alternatives extends the network for BUs and allows them to build system
thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization design&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The exploration project used internal ADT
resources and progressively solicited BUs’ resources for exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: The proposed concepts may call for an intra-BU or
inter-BU development depending on the interactions with existing BUs’
product architecture. BUs should then align as value is demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to 1.08&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model of coordination and collective action&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The exploration
projects were part of the overall ADT’s program of making
boundary-spanning proposal for BUs to develop intra and/or inter BU
products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: The sum of projects would potentially generate
organizational learning for BUs, if not, create product development
opportunities through top management program governance and sponsorship
from VP of Business Development and Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generative processes&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The Design Thinking, combined with ADT’s
experience and Practices, supported the exploration effort, in addition
to the ADT overarching design brief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: The generativity would be driven by user observation and
BUs segmentation to create the appropriate associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment cognition&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The generative processes have encoded the
need to scout the environment by targeting user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: The exploration projects would open a new and
demonstrated product development environment for BUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization design&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The exploration projects rely on ADT’s
resources and handover to BUs after selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: Transferring would imply technical documentation to fit
BUs available resources or identify new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;anomaly-client-value-demonstrated-but-no-npd&#34;&gt;Anomaly: client value demonstrated but no NPD&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to 1.08&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model of coordination and collective action&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The exploration is
guided by exploitation objectives (user pains) that are potentially
in-between BUs boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generative processes&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; The generativity is supported by Design
Thinking and added practices (multi-BU co-design workshops). The
assumption is made that the user and client value being demonstrated,
the concepts will naturally trigger their product development. The
generative process is naturally fixated by users (encoded in design
method).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment cognition&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; User experiences and BUs’ environment are
scouted. Design Thinking mainly develops concepts fixated by the
existing environment. When crazy concepts are generated, they are
adapted to what a BU would develop without considering capabilities
(re-)generation of the environment (product standards, certification,
sales channels).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization design&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; When crazy concepts are generated, they are
adapted to what a BU can develop without actually considering new or
recombination of capabilities within the BU or with other BUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comparison of the actual course of action with the models’
prediction reveals again the necessity to understand the
micro-foundations of exploration and exploitation, and their balance.
The generative process practice of Design Thinking gives an idea of the
direction of generativity and how it tries to build to innovation
potential of attraction through demonstrated user and client value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, none of the business units were interested in actually
committing to pushing the concepts further. They had accepted the
concepts and recognized their interest and client value. They had even
co-designed the concepts with ADT members, validated by VP Business
Development sponsorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exploration opened the path to new knowledge and better awareness of
the environment and system thinking. Opportunities of connecting BUs
together, through concepts revisiting interdependencies, were identified
as they would be usually hidden behind their traditional market and
product perspective. Nevertheless, the models fail in explaining why the
concepts are not developed by BUs as we discuss below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;co-design-acceptance-and-no-follow-up&#34;&gt;Co-design, acceptance and no follow-up&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;non-invented here syndrome&lt;/em&gt; could be of course flagged as being the
main reason for BUs not accepting to making these concepts their own.
Indeed, no project lines were added to the budget by Business Unit. Only
one added a line, but with zero budget, meaning they would perhaps
consider a paper study. The &lt;em&gt;death valley&lt;/em&gt; argument (Markham et al.

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Markham2010&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;) is also not really valid as BU can budget the
project, and budget consolidation is discussed with group CTO, ExCom and
each BU manager to decide how they size the budget with support from the
holding’s budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is even more surprising is the fact that engineers, designers and
managers from BUs participated to co-design workshops with other BUs.
They legitimized and made sense of the concepts themselves in addition
to welcoming the shared knowledge on users and value chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;exploring-alternative-aircraft-spaces&#34;&gt;Exploring alternative aircraft spaces&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the concepts generated with Design Thinking, as presented in

&lt;a href=&#34;https://mleglatin.github.io/project/design-thinking-for-innovation-management/&#34;&gt;our publication&lt;/a&gt;, were designed as if for BUs wouldn’t change. Moreover, the
decision process to rank and select concepts in order to be promoted to
BUs reinforced the stability of existing boundaries and engineering
capabilities, as well as markets domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some other cases, concepts generated through &lt;em&gt;What Ifs? scenario&lt;/em&gt;
allowed relieving some operational constraints (e.g. passengers storing
their personal luggage in containers, passengers participating to waste
sorting). These concepts unlocked interdependencies between aircraft
equipment and engineering as seen in C-K reference mapping. However, the
concepts were promoted as if BUs could just adapt them, without
emphasizing the radicality of the new perspective implying deep
reconfiguration of engineering design, system architecture and market
positioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have overall a good example of ambidextrous organization with a
supportive top management leadership, a valuable generative process,
deep interactions at different management levels. But, our literature
models fail to explain the absence of further product development or
even re-use of a feature in their technology and product roadmaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-synthesis&#34;&gt;Chapter synthesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on the methodology designed for our research questions, we have
taken each case individually by identifying a critical snapshot in the
project trajectories where the adaptive, interactive and encapsulated
models where used for predictions. By categorizing these with our
descriptors, and comparing them with the actual course of action, we
have spotted anomalies and discussed their justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we have demonstrated the fact that ambidexterity actually kills
innovation, which answers our first research question. We have also
managed to specify the different obstacles revealed by the analysis
supported by design theory and engineering bringing the necessity for an
micro-approach to the balancing of exploration and exploitation. Several
biases and fixations effects stem from the &lt;em&gt;non-mutual conditioning&lt;/em&gt;
between these two regimes, which appears to be no longer valid in the
unknown and high uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we have also stressed that the black-boxing of generative
processes within projects can later create controversies for middle/top
management as well as strategic coherence. Indeed, the separation of
exploration from exploitation at the organizational levels tends to
bring and reinforce &lt;strong&gt;organization design fixations&lt;/strong&gt;. It does not
encourage taking them into account within generative processes to value
the necessary change dynamics among resources nor the routines
supporting engineering practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, these results, specified in different ways through intra and
inter BU cases, give several hints to try to overcome the literature
models’ limitations to design an extended model reconciling with the
observed anomalies. Our aim would be to reconnect the ambidexterity
models with the unknown since innovation management has developed in
ways that the original non-mutual conditioning has lost ground.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is almost a &lt;em&gt;religious&lt;/em&gt; moment for engineers and the client who
is sometimes invited. People come to witness the first dynamic crash
test as it were a major milestone in the qualification process which
validates design choices &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, we propose to synthesize the anomalies highlighted by
the cases’ results of the previous chapter before listing the
requirements to design a new model extending the literature models of
non-mutual conditioning between exploration and exploitation, in order
to understand the observed phenomena.
The first feature raised through the descriptors and the comparison
between models’ prediction is perhaps the continuity and orthogonality
of exploration/exploitation that is dealt at different levels:
generative processes, coordination mechanisms, environment cognition and
organization design. So, we confirm the nuances expressed in (Gupta,
Smith, and Shalley 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Gupta2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;). What is perhaps more
surprising and natural at the same time is the fact that exploration can
be based on exploitation characteristics. However, the cases show these
can be beneficial or counter-productive for innovation management, thus
requiring an careful management to counter the forces of traditional
models of ambidexterity.
The second aspect is that we can assert that ambidexterity kills
innovation. It is of course a bold statement, but the meta-language of
exploration/exploitation tends to ignore the micro-foundations of
collective action such as decision-making and generative processes
(Birkinshaw and Gupta 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Birkinshaw2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;). The actual
implementation of ambidexterity, be it contextual, structural or
sequential, induces numerous complications dealing with
exploration/exploitation regime separation for practice. More
specifically, it appears to be incompatible with practices where the
unknown is effectively managed.
The cases show they follow organizational ambidexterity, but at the same
time, have mitigated efficiency when it comes to exploration or
exploitation standalone. Radical innovation is not really achieved for
the originally intended exploration project, despite having several
other valuable takeaways (Elmquist and Le Masson

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Elmquist2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;). There is tendency to leave exploitation
routines as a static reference point, as a fixation effect, and let
exploration free float in other directions without carefully managing
the search and generation directions.
Organization design being constricted by certification and market
constraints, generative processes and organization ambidexterity clashes
to support this enclosed change calling for a support of organizational
metabolism and potential &lt;em&gt;regenerative dynamic capabilities&lt;/em&gt; (Ambrosini,
Bowman, and Collier 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Ambrosini2009&#34;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;). Despite appropriate
interactionism, we have seen that practices are not sufficient to
sustain generative processes into a full settlement organizations. At
best, in the case of the icing conditions detection, the settlement is
partial as the alignment with BU management and Engineering department
remains controversial. Consequently, reconsidering organization design
supported/supporting generative processes appears crucial, as it
probably implies considering the mirroring of the engineering efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, we would propose some requirements extending the
literature models presented previously. These where limited to
non-mutual conditioning of exploration and exploitation. This extension
is crucial since the observed phenomena tends to show dynamics sustained
at the level of engineering design practices challenging the
coordination of exploration/exploitation conditioning and the management
of its innovation potential of attraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose to simply name this extended model by considering the
&lt;strong&gt;mutual conditioning between exploration and exploitation&lt;/strong&gt; as a means
to overcome the fixation effects which are managed at the engineering
design, organizational and environment levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;synthesis-of-anomalies&#34;&gt;Synthesis of anomalies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three cases presented in the previous chapter have insisted on
different limitations of the three proposed literature models of
non-mutual conditioning between exploration and exploitation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive model:&lt;/strong&gt; the search-based assumption of exploration is
overstretched by generative processes of different nature and locus.
Exploration is guided by uncertain or unknown (i.e. to be designed)
exploitation constraints as cleverly managed in the icing conditions
detection case. Whereas, it can also be a lock-in despite valuable
generativity on the user experience domain, as several fixation
effects of existing business units are not revisited as presented in
the ADT’s cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interactive model:&lt;/strong&gt; creation of meaning and value circulation
among (silent) designers around meetings and prototypes are not
sufficient to sustain radical innovation and the associate unknown
gradual shaping. The business class seat platform shows the
interference and conflicts arising from the exploration/exploitation
handover and agenda differences. It would require a management of
deeper learning mechanisms. Exploration and exploitation are
unfortunately both jeopardized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encapsulated model:&lt;/strong&gt; As already stressed in the literature on
project-based management, the need to link project trajectories with
underlying organizational ties, resources and routines is even more
critical at the light of exploration projects searching for
exploitation landing fields. Learning and change management tend to
be dissociated in exploration and exploitation regimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, we stress the anomalies raised by the cases compared to the
synthetic model portrait in the research questions chapter (p.). As the
reader will notice, some anomalies are reformulations further specifying
the limitations already raised in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we come back on the different observed anomalies based on the
models predictions by comparison with the actual course of actions. We
start then disentangling these anomalies before formulating our new
model requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;Non-mutual conditioning&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;Mutual conditioning&lt;/strong&gt; results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model of coordination and collective action&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; 1. Not necessarily on
the same continuum, exploration and exploitation call for two dissociate
action regimes. Balancing is left as a paradox at different levels of
analysis: structure (centralization, distribution), time and
individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp; 1. Exploration is driven by exploitation characteristics, sometimes
with loss of control. . Leaving the balancing as a paradox leaves
innovation unmanaged. Balancing exploration and exploitation can be
managed through sensemaking around prototypes and meetings, but does not
address the change management properly (partial or dynamic mirroring)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generative processes&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; 3. The nature of generative processes
supporting exploration appears quite free, random and sometimes even
foolishness-based. . Generativity of the product development may not be
sustained by (temporary) organizations (floating issue).. The
performance and reference is light structured: reduced to a selection
issue or sometimes to complex interactionist phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp; 3. Generative processes are partly directed if not biased by
exploitation constraints and not necessarily managed carefully. .
Generativity may indeed require radical organizational learning and
change but is not properly managed at the engineering design practice
level. . Performance is not necessarily discussed nor sanctioned but
appears as a conscious struggle that goes beyond selection process or
sensemaking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment cognition&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; 6. One-way interaction: Environment to
Organization. . The environment structures the response, nature and
distribution of generative processes.. The environment is used to
augment the product development requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp; 6. The environment may be actively managed to legitimize the
innovation potential.. Generative processes do not (systematically)
address and leverage fixations by the environment.. The environment
awareness does augment design requirements but struggles in identifying
the mirroring organization change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization design&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; 9. Organization design is pre-conceived or
uncontrolled. . Organization design creates gaps for managing generative
processes and the dynamics of their organizational ties. &amp;amp; 9.
Organizational ambidexterity conflicts with design and engineering
organizational mirroring.. Organization design is isolated by
exploration/exploitation dichotomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;generativity-biased-by-explorationexploitation-dichotomy&#34;&gt;Generativity biased by exploration/exploitation dichotomy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, it is important to note again that our research agenda set
from the beginning was to use advances in design reasoning and theory to
understand how generative processes and associated management of unknown
allows revisiting innovation management and the major construct of
ambidexterity. The cases presented earlier show how the models black-box
the nature of generative processes and their interferences with several
managerial dimensions such as: coordination mechanisms, environment
cognition and organization design.
Angela Dumas with Henry Mintzberg (Dumas and Mintzberg

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Dumas1989&#34;&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt;) had stressed the importance of &lt;em&gt;silent design&lt;/em&gt;
occurring across the organization. The cases reveal how these
distributed design activities can be framed and segregated by what
exploration and exploitation are in an ambidextrous organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the cases of the business class seat and ADT, the generative
processes had used clear exploitation characteristics to base their
exploration: seat packaging, integration and certification issues, and
user pains. It is used as a reference point, but at the same time when
balancing out exploration/exploitation, the generative processes require
an extreme adaption to exploitation organizational constraints despite
having made a strong effort on the cognitive and interactive dimensions.
The exploitation is conducted as if a simple extended or new list of
requirements had been given to the engineering departments. Risks can be
assessed, as well as maturity, but these registers are unfortunately
rather static. They may not capture and manage &lt;em&gt;epistemic
interdependencies&lt;/em&gt; accordingly (Puranam, Raveendran, and Knudsen

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Puranam2012a&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;).
Exploration efforts are then potentially biased by the non-mutual
conditioning. And inversely, the exploitation is heavily burdened by
exploration features that lack articulation with generated novelties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;killing-sustained-innovation-capabilities&#34;&gt;Killing sustained innovation capabilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of unknown, its management and generativity have been
underestimated in how they collide with adaptive, interactive and
encapsulated models. They stretch the boundaries of these management
models and challenge their viewpoint of collective action. The radical
innovation intent is severed by their limitations.
For instance, among the expected capabilities, the role of leadership,
top management and governance is stressed as being crucial. However, the
actual practice and implementation is rarely discussed in detail. The
different cases showed how management layers took an active role in
projects trajectories. Valuable practices were implemented ranging from
sensemaking, decision-making to sponsorship. These were meant to balance
the contradictions of exploration/exploitation trade-offs and the
results are partially successful and riddled by controversies.
The icing condition detection case creates a critical tension between
its business environment legitimacy and BU strategy and Engineering
appropriation. Following the retirement of the R&amp;amp;T manager, the
researcher had relayed his idea of licensing the technology to an
external firm capable (adequate cost-structure) to develop and
industrialize it for small aircrafts. This move would be a means to
actually set a foot on the aviation market, make a case for it before
fully demonstrating its usefulness for heavier aircrafts enhancing
flight safety. Again, such emergent strategy would be possible by fully
considering separation nor balance of both, as they explore and exploit
interconnected fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ignoring-organization-design-and-its-engineering-design-mirror&#34;&gt;Ignoring organization design and its engineering design mirror&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizational ambidexterity had highlighted ways of structuring the
balancing of exploration/exploitation adding different typologies on how
to sustain a competitive advantage. Oddly, separating it in space, time
or leaving it in context, brings some organization design into play but
only by sketching the organic dimension of it. For example, the
centralization of ADT at the group level or creation of a standalone R&amp;amp;T
team are fully prescribed. It still leaves numerous ties among members
with exploitation activities and extended environment constraints.
However the black-boxing of generative practices into these organic
systems ignores the risks associated with the potential need for
reconfiguration of stakeholders ties. Thus, the dynamics induced by
design practices require, not only a partial-mirroring by organizations,
but rather a mirroring dynamic.
For instance, the required adjustments, in terms of engineering
capabilities to engineer a seat platform architecture, require a
mirroring organization (Colfer and Baldwin 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Colfer2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;). The
change is not addressed within generative process and with &lt;em&gt;integrators&lt;/em&gt;
contributing to &lt;em&gt;interdependence shift&lt;/em&gt; (Stan and Puranam

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Stan2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;). The managers in charge of the projects were
acting as integrators. In the case of the seat platform, they a priori
managed to articulate the integration for the Engineering Department and
were later called back for further support. The same goes for ADT:
numerous sessions were organized during the exploration but also after
concept selection to follow up and adapt the preliminary designs trying
to facilitate the integration. As specified in the limitations section
(Stan and Puranam 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Stan2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, 1058): &lt;em&gt;A significant weakness
of this study is that it does not provide direct evidence for the
micro-mechanisms of how integrators help to cope with interdependence
shifts—only that they do (and that these effects are visible even at
intermediate performance stages).&lt;/em&gt;
The idea of a triple-loop of organizational learning (Leifer and
Steinert 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Leifer2011&#34;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;; McClory, Read, and Labib

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-McClory2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;), and the regenerative capabilities point in
that direction. But as they engage in a recursive pattern, as discussed
in the literature review, it appears crucial in the case studies to
frame the organization of collective action with practices that are
tightly linked to generative processes. In a more successful way, the
icing conditions detection case shows how future exploitation
constraints (regulation and norms) are shaped to support the technology
search and selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;specifying-requirements-for-a-new-model-of-ambidexterity&#34;&gt;Specifying requirements for a new model of ambidexterity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to our research questions (p.), we have stressed how
organizational ambidexterity can severe radical innovation practices
embodied by different generative processes. One could say that it is the
fault of organizational culture, but we have pointed in ZA’s
presentation (see p.), there are no signs of bad intentions raising
barriers again these radical innovation in the cases presentation and
results. Several practices and management tools were used to circulate
emergent value among stakeholders, including collective decision and
co-design workshops.
So, our first assumption would be to put the emphasis on the
micro-foundations. The nuts and bolts of generative processes and
interactions with value management, action and decision-making would be
absolutely critical to embody ambidextrous management. It fits the
behavioural foundations of March’s agenda (Gavetti, Levinthal, and
Ocasio 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Gavetti2007&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;) and it lies at the crossroads of design
theory and reasoning which can be understood as science extending
H.Simon’s work (Simon 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Simon1996&#34;&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;; Hatchuel

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hatchuel2001a&#34;&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;). Considering everyone as a designer in its
own way and practice, generating actions, interacting with other
(silent) designers and artefacts, could be a means to think of
generative processes among all of these organs and processes, which call
for a meta-process such as metabolism (Hatchuel, Weil, and Le Masson

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hatchuel2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;; Segrestin et al. 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Segrestin2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among our descriptors, we could then propose to consider what could be
explained by a metabolism. We consequently need to target what
contributes to such phenomenon that is neither structure nor traditional
process. Deriving from our observed and justified anomalies, we propose
to recentre organizational ambidexterity around decision-making by
bringing in the teachings of design theory at that level as well as
organizational design. We would then embed some sort hacking of the
constraints and biases induced by exploitation/exploration non-mutual
conditioning. Moreover, it will bring a dynamic mirroring hypothesis as
a means to reflect the organizational change supporting the generative
engineering design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;generative-process-and-ambidexterity-micro-foundations&#34;&gt;Generative process and ambidexterity micro-foundations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of our literature review up to the cases analyses, we
have discussed the course of action, decision-making and generative
processes. We have justified how organization ambidexterity can kill
sustained innovation management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we have to come back to foundations of the exploration versus
exploitation model whilst also keeping in mind the limitations and
perspectives identified in the interactive and encapsulated models.
The model’s extension we propose to address in the following part
(&lt;a href=&#34;#part:modelling&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;part:modelling&#34;&gt;[part:modelling]&lt;/a&gt;,
p.), should then almost start from a similar reasoning introduced in the
foundational paper (March 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-March1991&#34;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;). However, the
dichotomy of exploration and exploitation should be fully revisited by
considering &lt;strong&gt;a mutual conditioning&lt;/strong&gt; of both regimes as it was sketched
by the practices highlighted in the projects’ trajectories.
The nature of problems, their (re-)formulation and solving should be
reworked around the uncertainty and unknown management. Decision and
problem management should be enhanced by generative processes. For
instance, in (Le Glatin, Le Masson, and Weil 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-LeGlatin2017a&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;)
(appendix
&lt;a href=&#34;#chap:paper2&#34; data-reference-type=&#34;ref&#34; data-reference=&#34;chap:paper2&#34;&gt;[chap:paper2]&lt;/a&gt;,
p.), we associate the possibility to deliberately play around the
reversal of preferences to push decision-making into the unknown. We
have proposed to call such pattern &lt;strong&gt;decisional ambidexterity&lt;/strong&gt;.
Such practice should aim at identifying fixation effects and their
(epistemic) interdependencies. This &lt;strong&gt;technology of organizing&lt;/strong&gt; should
support creation of meaning, value management, engineering and a
baseline for coordination and collective action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;generative-processes-and-organization-design&#34;&gt;Generative processes and organization design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The free-floating of exploration projects, as they look for
organizational ties, should also think through the lens of design theory
and reasoning. The idea of design-oriented organization (Hatchuel, Weil,
and Le Masson 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hatchuel2006&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;) already pointed in that
direction. We need to specify with more clarity the organization design,
as we have seen that assumptions of temporary organization or
project-based organization tend to hide the complexities of changing
engineering design briefs in exploration project management.
Design theories and reasoning are usually discussed for products and
services, but one could consider the organization, its resources and
routines as concept-enabling-knowledge for design. So, the key
requirement of the model is to avoid black-boxing generative processes,
as we have seen they expand onto several management dimensions. We
should then put the emphasis on potential &lt;strong&gt;organization design
fixation&lt;/strong&gt; that are not naturally part of the engineering design
practice, nor traditional project management. These are usually
discussed in change (project) management and organizational change but
would probably benefit from richer synergies if embedded in actual
project management (Pollack 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Pollack2017&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;; Hornstein

&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-Hornstein2015&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;).
Consequently, our &lt;strong&gt;model of mutual conditioning between exploration and
exploitation&lt;/strong&gt; should also aim at managing an organizational metabolism
necessary to sustain organization re-design as a necessary condition
supporting the innovation potential of attraction of - so far
black-boxed - generative processes in exploration project management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;chapter-synthesis&#34;&gt;Chapter synthesis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the previous chapter, we were able to identify literature
models’ weaknesses and several hints given by the case studies. The
synthesis of results reveals, through tracking of generative processes
in projects trajectories, that there is in fact a conditioning managed
or left uncontrolled between exploration and exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we propose to return to the micro-foundations of organizational
ambidexterity as generative processes interfere with several management
dimensions depending on their generativity. Some are indeed more or less
fixated by exploitation constraints, and some are actually actively used
to generate concepts. Therefore, focusing on the model of action,
decision-making and generative processes would be a means to specify how
managers, individual and (silent) designers should interact with such
constraints to manage the generativity of their practice embedded in
projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the case studies results encourage to focus on the dynamics of
the mirroring hypothesis, as the generative processes may challenge to
some extent interdependencies that can be catastrophic to exploration
value and subsequent exploitation. Radical innovation fostered by
generative processes may indeed be fixated by organization design, thus
winking at bringing organization design as concept enabling knowledge
supporting product design practices. Change management could be then
brought at the level of product project management and the underlying
generative mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have a requirements baseline to continue our journey to
design a &lt;strong&gt;model of mutual conditioning between exploration and
exploitation&lt;/strong&gt;. We have new grounds extending the studied literature
models and reconnecting ambidexterity with its behavioural foundations
at the light of the teachings of design theory and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
