We analyse two cases where new concepts were developed and promoted to business units for implementation by following DT methodology. Our study shows that the DT routine reveals some generative power to explore the user perspective, yet it appears uncontrolled when it comes to generate a wider variety of ideas and knowledge challenging the design ecosystem ontology omitted and made invariant through user-focus hence it faces difficulties to engage with stakeholders and other organisational routines for an enhanced creativity and organisational change.","tags":["design theory","design thinking","organization","routine","management","creativity"],"title":"Measuring the generative power of an organisational routine with design theories: the case of design thinking in a large firm","type":"publication"}]
