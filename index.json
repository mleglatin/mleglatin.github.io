We contribute to the foundations of management by making the unknown an actionable notion for the decision‐maker. To this end, we build on the pioneering works in ‘managing in the unknown’ and on design theory to systematically characterize rational forms of action in the unknown. We show that action consists of designing decisions in the unknown and can be organized on the basis of the notion of a ‘decision‐driven design path,’ which is not yet a decision but helps to organize the generation of a better decision‐making situation. Our decision‐design model allows us to identify four archetypes of decision‐driven design paths. They enable us to discuss the variety of known organizational forms that managers can rely on to explore the unknown.","tags":["decision theory","design theory","C-K","unknown","uncertainty","ambidexterity"],"title":"Designing Decisions in the Unknown: A Generative Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mario Le Glatin","Pascal Le Masson","Benoit Weil"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1585243029,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585243029,"objectID":"8d4941c9fd5186fbb6d123d5291c1046","permalink":"https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/pub-leglatin2018a/","publishdate":"2019-01-26T17:28:57+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pub-leglatin2018a/","section":"publication","summary":"The academic construction of ambidexterity articulated around notions such as exploration, exploitation (J. March 1991) has been flourishing over the years with a strong background in organisational theory to explain levels of performance and innovation. However, they have also made a call for in-depth studies to understand managerial capabilities such as decision-making (Birkinshaw \u0026 Gupta 2013; O’Reilly \u0026 Tushman 2013; Benner \u0026 Tushman 2015) supporting the tension of competing objectives. In this paper, we show that organisational ambidexterity can kill innovation as the underlying decision theories are not fully supporting the nature of decision required in regimes such as contextual ambidexterity (Gibson \u0026 Birkinshaw 2004). Two case studies from the aircraft cabin equipment industry are presented and analysed at the project management level with descriptors from organisational ambidexterity and decision-making. We propose to consider unconventional decision theories, taking into account non-expected utilities such as potential regret of imagined prospects, as a means to support management tools enabling ambidexterity at the decisional and contextual levels. First, we show that common decision models based on expected utility encoded in management tools mobilised for contextual ambidexterity can fail to support innovation. Second, we propose that a non-expected utility, such as potential regret of imagined prospects, serves the management of competing exploration/exploitation objectives. Third, the case studies help contouring a management tool extending observed attempts to sustain or extend contextual ambidexterity through unconventional decision-making.","tags":["management","ambiexterity","anomaly","performance","organization","generativity","deciion-making","non-expected","unexpected","unknown","utility"],"title":"Can organisational ambidexterity kill innovation?

DT success appears as a symptom of the emergence of a design paradigm in innovation management (Boland and Collopy 2004; Le Masson, Weil, and Hatchuel 2010; Gruber et al. 2015; Seidel and Fixson 2013; Ben Mahmoud-Jouini, Midler, and Silberzahn 2016). Here lie the potential limits of DT because it is presented as method, inspired by a profession, and its theoretical foundations require further grounding (von Thienen et al. 2018). Consequently, casting DT into design theory will reveal some flaws as well as its potential because it will also reveal ways to expand DT into a new generation of techniques to support the metabolism (Hatchuel, Weil, and Le Masson 2006) of innovative firms and ecosystems. In this paper, we propose to use design theories frameworks to analyze cases of DT-in-use in a large firm to reveal its generativity and defixation capacity. We explicitly show the extent of learning metabolisms and potential user fixations encoded in the DT method. It encourages proposing ways of extending with other techniques to validate and support the potentials of DT as it has been developed through decades.

Among the foundations, the manager is considered following axioms describing his rationality; the most prominent ones being transitivity and independence. The order in preferences is not supposed be reversed yet unknown events of nature may perturb our understanding and may require designing new decisions going against decision theories, hence increasing uncertainty. In this paper we propose a model of decision making in the unknown whose hypotheses are tested on an industrial case in order to show that traditional decision making is not able to grasp the natural phenomenon of expansion and generativity as a manager senses the unknown in an innovation project. Bayesian Nets with Abraham Wald's foundations are used to sense the re-ordering preferences and the benefits of designing one's playground and being intransitive. The purpose is also to contribute to the idea that design theories, theories studying generative processes, by opposition to optimisation (decision theory) and ideation (creativity theory) can help extend the underlying logic of innovation management.","tags":["decision theory","design theory","creativity","innovation","project management","ambidexterity","generativity","deciion-making","non-expected","unexpected","unknown","utility"],"title":"Decision design and re-ordering preferences: the case of an exploration project in a large firms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mario Le Glatin"],"categories":[],"content":"A collection of related academic publications and posts on the topic of decision-making and design theory as studied and managed in organizations.\n\rWork in Progress\u0026hellip;\r\r\r","date":1585241741,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585241741,"objectID":"5f7f1f90eec8ba5020d9e9156370dc61","permalink":"https://mleglatin.github.io/project/designing-decision-theory/","publishdate":"2020-03-26T17:55:41+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/designing-decision-theory/","section":"project","summary":"A collection of related academic publications and posts on the topic of decision-making and design theory as studied and managed in organizations.\n\rWork in Progress\u0026hellip;\r\r\r","tags":[],"title":"Designing Decision Theory","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mario Le Glatin"],"categories":[],"content":"A collection of related academic publications and posts on the topic of ambidexterity as studied and managed in organizations.\n\rWork in Progress\u0026hellip;\r\r\r","date":1585241647,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585241647,"objectID":"8b62be1a1aabbbf44a3124ffe0114294","permalink":"https://mleglatin.github.io/project/ambidexterity-exploration-exploitation/","publishdate":"2020-03-26T17:54:07+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/ambidexterity-exploration-exploitation/","section":"project","summary":"A collection of related academic publications and posts on the topic of ambidexterity as studied and managed in organizations.\n\rWork in Progress\u0026hellip;\r\r\r","tags":[],"title":"Ambidexterity: Exploration and Exploitation","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mario Le Glatin"],"categories":[],"content":"A collection of related academic publications and posts on the topic of design thinking as studied and managed in organizations.\n\rWork in Progress\u0026hellip;\r\r\r","date":1585241519,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585241519,"objectID":"7bba35793f8b2c660894888ab27ded51","permalink":"https://mleglatin.github.io/project/design-thinking-for-innovation-management/","publishdate":"2020-03-26T17:51:59+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/design-thinking-for-innovation-management/","section":"project","summary":"A collection of related academic publications and posts on the topic of design thinking as studied and managed in organizations.\n\rWork in Progress\u0026hellip;\r\r\r","tags":[],"title":"Design Thinking for Innovation Management","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mario Le Glatin","Pascal Le Masson","Benoit Weil"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1585241149,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585241149,"objectID":"8212d22a094a273dcf9998b5df75365f","permalink":"https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/pub-leglatin2016/","publishdate":"2016-10-16T12:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pub-leglatin2016/","section":"publication","summary":"This article studies how a large firm uses Design Thinking (DT) as a core process in specific design and development team whose mission is to bridge the gap between unidentified market needs and business units research \u0026 development effort.
