Among the foundations, the manager is considered following axioms describing his rationality; the most prominent ones being transitivity and independence. The order in preferences is not supposed be reversed yet unknown events of nature may perturb our understanding and may require designing new decisions going against decision theories, hence increasing uncertainty. In this paper we propose a model of decision making in the unknown whose hypotheses are tested on an industrial case in order to show that traditional decision making is not able to grasp the natural phenomenon of expansion and generativity as a manager senses the unknown in an innovation project. Bayesian Nets with Abraham Wald's foundations are used to sense the re-ordering preferences and the benefits of designing one's playground and being intransitive. The purpose is also to contribute to the idea that design theories, theories studying generative processes, by opposition to optimisation (decision theory) and ideation (creativity theory) can help extend the underlying logic of innovation management.","tags":["decision theory","design theory","creativity","innovation","project management","ambidexterity","generativity","deciion-making","non-expected","unexpected","unknown","utility"],"title":"Decision design and re-ordering preferences: the case of an exploration project in a large firms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mario Le Glatin"],"categories":[],"content":"A collection of related academic publications and posts on the topic of decision-making and design theory as studied and managed in organizations.\n\rWork in Progress\u0026hellip;\r\r\r","date":1585241741,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585241741,"objectID":"5f7f1f90eec8ba5020d9e9156370dc61","permalink":"https://mleglatin.github.io/project/designing-decision-theory/","publishdate":"2020-03-26T17:55:41+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/designing-decision-theory/","section":"project","summary":"A collection of related academic publications and posts on the topic of decision-making and design theory as studied and managed in organizations.\n\rWork in Progress\u0026hellip;\r\r\r","tags":[],"title":"Designing Decision Theory","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mario Le Glatin"],"categories":[],"content":"A collection of related academic publications and posts on the topic of ambidexterity as studied and managed in organizations.\n\rWork in Progress\u0026hellip;\r\r\r","date":1585241647,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585241647,"objectID":"8b62be1a1aabbbf44a3124ffe0114294","permalink":"https://mleglatin.github.io/project/ambidexterity-exploration-exploitation/","publishdate":"2020-03-26T17:54:07+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/ambidexterity-exploration-exploitation/","section":"project","summary":"A collection of related academic publications and posts on the topic of ambidexterity as studied and managed in organizations.\n\rWork in Progress\u0026hellip;\r\r\r","tags":[],"title":"Ambidexterity: Exploration and Exploitation","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mario Le Glatin"],"categories":[],"content":"A collection of related academic publications and posts on the topic of design thinking as studied and managed in organizations.\n\rWork in Progress\u0026hellip;\r\r\r","date":1585241519,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585241519,"objectID":"7bba35793f8b2c660894888ab27ded51","permalink":"https://mleglatin.github.io/project/design-thinking-for-innovation-management/","publishdate":"2020-03-26T17:51:59+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/design-thinking-for-innovation-management/","section":"project","summary":"A collection of related academic publications and posts on the topic of design thinking as studied and managed in organizations.\n\rWork in Progress\u0026hellip;\r\r\r","tags":[],"title":"Design Thinking for Innovation Management","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mario Le Glatin","Pascal Le Masson","Benoit Weil"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1585241149,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585241149,"objectID":"8212d22a094a273dcf9998b5df75365f","permalink":"https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/pub-leglatin2016/","publishdate":"2016-10-16T12:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pub-leglatin2016/","section":"publication","summary":"This article studies how a large firm uses Design Thinking (DT) as a core process in specific design and development team whose mission is to bridge the gap between unidentified market needs and business units research \u0026 development effort. We analyse two cases where new concepts were developed and promoted to business units for implementation by following DT methodology. Our study shows that the DT routine reveals some generative power to explore the user perspective, yet it appears uncontrolled when it comes to generate a wider variety of ideas and knowledge challenging the design ecosystem ontology omitted and made invariant through user-focus hence it faces difficulties to engage with stakeholders and other organisational routines for an enhanced creativity and organisational change.","tags":["design theory","design thinking","organization","routine","management","creativity","generativity"],"title":"Measuring the generative power of an organisational routine with design theories: the case of design thinking in a large firm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mario"],"categories":["website"],"content":"","date":1585238680,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585238680,"objectID":"841eb82a2b015d38388954a87ac4d891","permalink":"https://mleglatin.github.io/post/website-announcement/","publishdate":"2020-03-26T17:04:40+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/website-announcement/","section":"post","summary":"A brief overview of what this website will cover","tags":["website","content"],"title":"Website Announcement \u0026 Content Roadmap","type":"post"}]
