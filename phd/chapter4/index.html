          <div class="article-style">
            <p>In this chapter, we present the methodology deployed over the three
years of the PhD thesis. The methodology relies on an
intervention-research approach (Hatchuel and David

<a href="#ref-Hatchuel2008">2008</a>) facilitated by the CIFRE contract
(<em>Convention Industrielle de Formation par la REcherche</em> - Industrial
Convention of Training through Research).</p>
<p>First, in section 
<a href="#principles-of-intervention-research-in-management">1</a>,
we introduce the principles of intervention-research in management.
Then, in section 
<a href="#anomaly-detection-and-modelling">2</a>,
we present the data collection process with the associated analysis
based on the literature model. We follow an anomaly detection
methodology in order to formulate a new model that was tested during the
last stretch of three years of the research program through validation
and application within ZA. The final section 
<a href="#role-and-position-of-the-researcher---intervention-research">3</a>
portraits the position of the PhD candidate within the firm.</p>

<p>The Intervention Research in Management (IRM) has been elaborated over
several decades of research partnerships at <em>Centre de Gestion
Scientifique</em> (Hatchuel and David 
<a href="#ref-Hatchuel2008">2008</a>).This
approach has proven efficient in revealing the intricacies of complex
managerial situations specially in the innovation management field with
the multiplicity and novelty of interactions, decisions, knowledge flows
in project and strategy management. IRM relies on two pillars: a
<strong>collaborative protocol and theoretical perspective</strong>.
The aim is not to solve a definite problem proposed by an organization.
The theoretical setting can actually be rather dull at the beginning
despite bearing a certain potential. Nonetheless, a dialectic between
<em>established-theories-in</em> use and <em>contextual-established-in-use</em> allows
improving models of action. The point is nor to perform change
management, but rather to gain an understanding of theories-in-use,
their performativity and how models of thought can evolve within the
business. This continuous monitoring between academia and industry
through the PhD candidate enables uncovering a real research issue

<p>Given this set of conditions and practices, the outputs emerge naturally
following the dynamic and symmetric feedback supported by the PhD
candidate through his meetings, steering committees with academia and
industrial colleagues. It implies testing models of thought, frameworks
drawn from the literature, and models grounded on field data based on
the case studies conducted.</p>
<h3 id="initial-management-issue-formulation">Initial management issue formulation</h3>
<p>Originally, the PhD research program was designed to address the topic
of economic performance of design at Airbus Aircraft. At that time, the
PhD candidate was already working within Zodiac Aerospace.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> The
program discussed how design activities of project and program
management could be valued by alternative means to project objectives.
For instance, it raised that traditional learning mechanisms between
projects were hard to track such as spill-overs (Cohen and Levinthal

<a href="#ref-Cohen1989a">1989</a>), and how learning could be managed from a
project to another in an efficient manner. The performance dimension,
its definition and underlying value management was central for the
topic. Today, as the PhD project was not launched in July 2015, it was
put on hold and is currently being dealt by a PhD fellow at CGS (Agathe
Gillain).</p>
<p>As this PhD subject would not come to life in its original form by 2015,
we proposed to reallocate the project to Zodiac Aerospace. With the
support of the Group HR management, a new sponsor was to be found:
Thierry Rouge Carrassat, Chief Technical and Innovation Officer for
Zodiac Aerospace. Several meetings were organized between the PhD
Directors and the CTO to provide information on the company, its
history, its context, innovation management practices and how the PhD
program would be framed by IRM methodology.
The topic was adapted, it discarded part of the economic performance
axis: the topic recentred around the old dilemma of market-pull vs.
techno-push. ZA presented several cases trying to overcome the growing
rationalization of market-pull by aircraft manufacturers and airlines.
For instance, they had two development teams close enough to market
prescribers in order to try to anticipate market-pull trends and
formulate proposal of new products/services that could federate several
BUs for more added value.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as business units were highly profitable in their
respective niche-markets covered over the history of acquisitions,
corporate management had been sponsoring techno-push initiatives. These
were steered through a <em>Multi-BU committee</em> showcasing a mix of top-down
and bottom-up approaches.</p>
<p>Another salient feature was the history of acquisitions and expansion
since the establishment of the company in 1896. Zodiac Aerospace was a
conglomerate of SMEs with individual responsibility for each BUs grouped
based on market segmentation and technology proximity into so-called:
business lines, divisions and branches.

pour la Recherche et la Technologie</em>) - the agency sponsoring the CIFRE
PhD Programs nationwide.</p>
<h3 id="phases-of-irm">Phases of IRM</h3>
<p>Intervention research can be split into different phases that do not
necessarily represent a linear story in the research journey. The phases
are the following: feeling of discomfort, rational myth, intervention
and research, portraying a set of logics and change process.
Starting with this <em>feeling of discomfort</em> with respect to the open
management issues identified, the researcher in an abductive fashion
starts generating hypothesis on raw data collected through open
interviews with a wide variety of actors across business units.</p>
<p>The investigation is followed by the definition and gradual elaboration
of a <em>rational myth</em>. This myth reflects as a potential model, and
reference to rely on to explain and coordinate collective action. As
exposed by Bachelard in his thesis &ldquo;<em>Essai sur la connaissance
approchée</em>&rdquo; (Essay on approximated knowledge) (Bachelard

<a href="#ref-Bachelard1927">1927</a>) to explain scientific knowledge development
and constructivist epistemology:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The order of sensibilities does not necessarily follow the salient
features, what we could call the <span class="underline">dynamic
topography of our experience</span>. We indeed have little agreement
with the simplification of the prior phenomenon of every scientific
development. We think the primordial features stand out by themselves
and establish themselves forcibly to our study through their
generality. Nevertheless, sometimes it is the accident and not the
general that is explanation principle to the point where problems
should be overturned to restore the generality to the phenomenal
features the spirit had represented in special meaning.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should not be mistaken for serendipitous discoveries but his work
stresses the importance of experimentation, seen as the <em>contact between
Thought and Reality</em> which is the only way of specifying the mode of
existence. The knowledge is thus approximated by a movement of
conjunction from Thought to Reality, which are supported by means of
<em>intervention and interaction</em>. The gradual and often non-linear shaping
of knowledge allows the researcher to <em>portray a set of logics</em>. Up to
this phasing, the purpose of the researcher is mainly to explain and
bring to the surface the rationality mobilized in the collective action.
In that regard, we adopt an <em>ordinary</em> perspective of rationality
(Boudon 
<a href="#ref-Boudon2012">2012</a>). We avoid the potential patchwork and
associated burst of the notion of rationality, and stunning relativism
that social sciences can sometimes produce. Of course, we cannot pretend
to discard existing theories that explain collective action through
according to different research programs (Lakatos

<a href="#ref-Lakatos1980">1980</a>): utility, materiality, mechanistic or
cognitive.
The methodological individualism required to reveal the <em>set of logics</em>,
and <em>rational myth</em>, tends to adopt a cognitive approach to understand
social phenomena which are the implications of the individual actions
inspired by reasons. It is a means of avoiding pitfalls as explained by
R.Boudon (Boudon 
<a href="#ref-Boudon2012">2012</a>): solipsism, psychologism,
procedural knowledge and programmatic approaches, dispositional
variables, restrictive axiomatic such as rational choice theory and
expressive rationality (Frega 
<a href="#ref-Frega2010">2010</a>). So, we tend to
look for how these reasons are shaped within and without context. We
also identify the research program Max Weber’s proposition in his
treatise on the Sociology of Religion (Weber 
<a href="#ref-Weber1946">1946</a>,
280):</p>
<p><em>Not ideas, but material and ideal interests directly govern men’s
conduct. Yet very frequently the ‘world-images’ that have been created
by ‘ideas’ have, like switchmen, determined the tracks along which
action has been pushed by the dynamic of interest</em></p>
<p>The researcher in his generative search will then test his evolving
understanding with the field through different <em>intervention and
interaction</em> devices, acting as measuring devices and testing:
interviews, questions with given semantics, presentations of models,
steering committees, discussions with supervisors. And finally, there is
a need for predictability in the new understanding built by the
researcher which comes in the form of a <em>change process</em>. This change
occurs mainly from the understanding of <em>Reality</em> of the studied domain.
It does not necessarily imply the implementation of new management tool,
or rationality organizing collective action, but rather a learning
process due to the scientific understanding. We will come back to this
in the section
<a href="#sec:scientific_method" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:scientific_method">2</a>,
as we propose a methodology of anomaly detection.</p>
<h3 id="data-collection">Data collection</h3>
<p>The vast majority of data was collected in the group Zodiac Aerospace
through the variety of interactions with actors of the firm. Given the
nature of our research, a diverse sample of data type was sourced across
the research ground.
From the beginning of the PhD journey until the end, a large sample of
resources: meeting minutes, presentations, TRL assessments,
technology/product roadmaps, project statements, project &amp; program
documentation stored on local networks, intranet, etc.</p>
<p>Another set of data was gathered through active participation to
workshop, seminars, meetings where sometimes where the researcher was
invited for observation and we must add data collection with varying
degrees of intervention: writing workshops, working groups, interviews,
project meetings and seminars.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="anomaly-detection-and-modelling">Anomaly detection and modelling</h2>
<p>As we will present in the following sections and following chapters
(Chapter
<a href="#chap:methodo2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="chap:methodo2">[chap:methodo2]</a>),
we have a small-sample research contained in a large conglomerate of
SMEs. The different phases of IRM tend to overlap and provide feedback
between themselves. Overall, we have the three main categories of logics
interacting with each other(Dana and Dumez 
<a href="#ref-Dana2015">2015</a>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Deduction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inference</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abduction</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Given the sample size and in order to provide meaningful results for
academia and practice, demonstrating a case of anomaly is key from a
statistical standpoint (Siggelkow 
<a href="#ref-Siggelkow2007">2007</a>). The
purpose is to carefully observe a counter-example to the models
extracted from literature (Part
<a href="#part:anomaly" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="part:anomaly">[part:anomaly]</a>),
then propose a new model explaining the phenomenon and extending
existing theories (Part
<a href="#part:modelling" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="part:modelling">[part:modelling]</a>).
In this section, we present how we mobilize the idea of comprehensive
research (Dana and Dumez 
<a href="#ref-Dana2015">2015</a>; Dumez

<a href="#ref-Dumez2016">2016</a>) to elicit counter-examples of existing models in
the literature and design a new one. There are three main risks
associated highlighted by the method:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Abstract actors or being of reasons</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Circularity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equifinality</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These three major risks will serve as a baseline to promote
counter-factual reasoning with the elucidated anomalies by putting the
effort on creating a typology, stress mechanisms between levels of
analysis through a set unit of analysis, and proposition of a new
concept redefining and extending existing theories.</p>
<h3 id="detecting-an-anomaly-in-management">Detecting an anomaly in management</h3>
<p>One of the movements of a comprehensive research (Dana and Dumez

<a href="#ref-Dana2015">2015</a>) can be seen as a modulation of deductive
research. The selected literature and associated models tell us what to
observe when scouting the research ground, with a risk of being trapped
with circularity. The first step consisted in analysing theoretical
frameworks relating to ambidexterity, exploration project management,
strategy management and organizational design/studies in face of the
unknown. It is also a way of rephrasing the elaboration of the <em>rational
myth</em> and <em>set of logics portrait</em>. Based on the literature review (Part
<a href="#part:literature" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="part:literature">[part:literature]</a>),
we were able to select several of these frameworks which are key to
identify a phenomenon unknown to academic literature in contrast with
the synthesised model of <strong>non-mutual conditioning of
exploration/exploitation</strong>.</p>
<p>The analysis requires to extract typologies and mechanisms of phenomena
observed in the selected literature that shed light on the anomaly. The
descriptors are introduced to stress issues and limitations already
identified in the literature. It will also facilitate the
instrumentation to describe the purpose of our research questions, hence
the anomalies and their implications (Part
<a href="#part:anomaly" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="part:anomaly">[part:anomaly]</a>).
We have selected the common descriptors: <strong>model of coordination and
collective action</strong>, <strong>innovation potential of attraction</strong> (<em>generative
processes</em>, <em>environment cognition</em> and <em>organization design</em>). The
literature review aimed at stress testing major models of ambidexterity
in order to see that the construct had drifted overtime and locally
<em>delaminated</em> as innovation management had evolve to embrace the unknown
specially with exploration project management. These were analysed with
inputs from design theories and reasoning embodying generative
processes. Several assumptions and limitations were identified with the
help of the descriptors as presented in the research questions (p.).</p>
<p>In the first chapter
(<a href="#chap:results_ano" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="chap:results_ano">[chap:results_ano]</a>),
a first batch of results from selected case studies (see Table
<a href="#table:papers1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="table:papers1">[table:papers1]</a>
p. in section
<a href="#sec:case_selection" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:case_selection">[sec:case_selection]</a>)
will be presented revealing anomalies. This is based on the chosen
descriptors and synthesized version of the anomaly detection articles.
In a second chapter
(<a href="#chap:anomalies_spec" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="chap:anomalies_spec">[chap:anomalies_spec]</a>),
we will then have to further specify these anomalies revealing in more
detail the limitations and underlying assumptions found in the
literature review (see research questions p.). Finally, the anomaly
detection should lay the requirements to build up a new model revisiting
and extending literature models in order to explain the abnormal
phenomena.</p>
<h3 id="data-analysis">Data analysis</h3>
<p>We must mobilize a unit of analysis that opposes inference and abductive
logics. The first calls for explanations, typologies and mechanisms the
selected literature will allow us to observe. The second is more
independent from the literature and tends to extract what the research
ground can &ldquo;tell us&rdquo; through the variations observations and
interactions/interventions. The two are far from being independent in
practice, there is a constant confrontation bore by the researcher
himself echoing a declination of the Hawthorne Effect.
The two different sets of data allow us to confront the two logics
separately over the collected documentation and the variety of field
notes (interviews, meetings and workshops participation). The unit of
analysis is crucial to elicit the articulation between the levels of
analysis (from the individual to the organization/ecosystem) and
associated mechanisms evolving through the timeline of the case studies.
So, we would tend to have a ‘mesoscopic’ approach as the typologies
drawn from the literature review, in association with event-system
theory invite us to play on different levels and temporalities (Griffin

<a href="#ref-Griffin1993">1993</a>; Griffin and Ragin 
<a href="#ref-Griffin1994">1994</a>;
Morgeson, Mitchell, and Liu 
<a href="#ref-Morgeson2015">2015</a>). The other
benefit is that it forces the researcher to disentangle black-boxes that
may have been contoured in the literature such as <em>abstract actors</em> and
<em>beings of reason</em>.
We propose then to explicit the selected descriptors (see chapter
<a href="#chap:rquest" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="chap:rquest">[chap:rquest]</a>,
p.) over time as the decision-making and action is engaged by actors
(designers, engineers, managers, etc.), within projects and within
committees. We then suggest to look at the time-sequence of the
following derived descriptors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>decision/problem space design</strong>: decision and problem formulation
is extracted from documentation and conducted interviews for the
different surveyed selected projects. The input from design theory
from a methodological standpoint also helps to envision a large
decision/problem space which was discussed with interviewees (as the
possible course of action).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>actual made decisions</strong>: recorded from project history,
documentation and interviews</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>engaged course of action</strong>: recorded from project history,
documentation and interviews</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>organization design</strong>: supporting (temporary) organizations were
found in project documentations and interviews and also directly
observed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, if we propose to represent a project management for a
standardized product development, the descriptors allow us to show the
linear and supposed stability that is adapted through risk management
procedures. The figure
<a href="#fig:refdescriptors" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:refdescriptors">1</a>
below gives an idea of how this would be done.</p>
<figure>
<img src="refdescriptors.png" id="fig:refdescriptors" alt="" /><figcaption>Derived descriptors representation for a <em>traditional</em> development project.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This analytical lens remains very useful to draw the project trajectory,
its coordination mechanisms and collective action. However, we must
stress that it may also become chaotic as real life management, and
interaction with the environment and organizations is not without
obstacles. So we must highlight these obstacles and specify what the
literature models of <strong>non-mutual conditioning between exploration and
exploitation</strong> would have predicted compared to the actual course action
depicted with our descriptors.
<strong>Note:</strong> In order to specify and make sense of these obstacles,
numerous control variables can of course be added as we have discussed
in the literature review to counter contingencies and concomitant
phenomena. Adding them may raise model’s fitness with data but not
necessarily up to a point of reaching perfect congruence from a
statistical viewpoint. Consequently, we will address some of common
control variables and clarify how influential they could have been or
not in order to make a case for the anomaly as easily as possible.</p>
<h3 id="modelling-naming-explaining-and-testing">Modelling: Naming, explaining and testing</h3>
<p>Finally, the anomaly detection encourages the researcher to formalize a
new model mitigating some perspectives addressed by the research
questions and the observed phenomena. The novelty invites <em>naming</em> the
phenomenon based on traces left by academics or practitioners to weave a
model from it.</p>
<p>The new model is introduced in Part
<a href="#part:modelling" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="part:modelling">[part:modelling]</a>,
it should be <em>free-standing</em>: plausible on its own due to the showcased
logics of the conceptual argument (Siggelkow 
<a href="#ref-Siggelkow2007">2007</a>,
21). Despite being backed by the cases, it also requires elevating the
model from the idiosyncrasy of the cases themselves.
Our model will support a novel explanation of the anomalies presented in
the chapters
<a href="#chap:modelling" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="chap:modelling">[chap:modelling]</a>
and
<a href="#chap:modelling2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="chap:modelling2">[chap:modelling2]</a>
in Part
<a href="#part:modelling" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="part:modelling">[part:modelling]</a>.
The validity of the model is presented in chapter
<a href="#chap:validationcase" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="chap:validationcase">[chap:validationcase]</a>
and in Part
<a href="#part:intervention" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="part:intervention">[part:intervention]</a>
through the different ways in which the researcher intervened in the
research ground: contributions to projects and management procedures.
For IRM phasing, it corresponds to the establishment of a new <em>rational
myth</em> proposing a new way of organizing collective action. The support
and reaction to this experimentation is detailed in the two chapters
where the model was experimented and validated by peers. Moreover, this
experimentation of the model validates the status of the model as a
building block providing an understanding of complex mechanisms, laying
a path along the research questions perspectives for a future theory
with exploratory hypotheses (Part
<a href="#part:discussion" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="part:discussion">[part:discussion]</a>).
Now, we have specified the different descriptors to detect the potential
anomalies, we need to be able to compare models derived from literature
with the case studies. We propose then in the following paragraphs the
adaptive, interactive and encapsulated models. They represent different
models of ambidexterity as we have seen throughout our literature review
along the chosen descriptors.
The <strong>adaptive model</strong> is mainly concerned with responding to the
environment by organizing the firm in a way that it is a priori capable
to answer to potential changes. The generative processes such as radical
innovation are then structured by the organization design and
environment cognition.
The <strong>interactive model</strong> tends to deepen the contingencies of
generative processes by stressing the importance of relationships,
emergent new ones so that new routines can be recombined through the
open-ended network dynamics. The organization design are shaped to the
complexity of relationships tied through generative interactions.
The <strong>encapsulated model</strong> brings a more ‘organic’ view by framing
generativity with the scope of a project supported by a temporary
organization also tied functionally to resource-providing organizations.
The change dynamics of the (temporary) organization are the mirror’s
image of the net of projects engaged with the environment and program
office/governance’s strategic input.</p>
<h4 id="adaptive-model-coping-with-the-environments-dynamics">Adaptive model: coping with the environment’s dynamics</h4>
<p>In the adaptive model, what is critical is the way in which the adaptive
process rooted in problem-solving, and by-extension decision-making
(probabilities on solutions), moved from organizational learning with a
concern for exploration and exploitation regime to being a key construct
to think the firm’s innovation performance in addition to having
competitive advantage. Mutations of the organization structure and
process are the answer to environment changes. Variation and selection
should be then managed to ensure an efficient exploration.
The other salient feature is that it tends to prescribe organization
design with different level of analysis that should be the
responsibility of top management as they are considered among the few to
bring system thinking and thus conduct strategy. The underlying
foundations such as decision-making and dynamic capabilities building
remain quite obscure (Birkinshaw and Gupta 
<a href="#ref-Birkinshaw2013">2013</a>)
and may lead to complicated managerial action.</p>
<p>to 1 &amp;
<strong>Model of coordination and collective action</strong> &amp; Generative processes &amp;
Environment cognition &amp; Organization design</p>
<p>Top management and leadership are the corner stone shaping the adaptive
processes supporting innovation management. They oversee organizational
learning and relationships balancing exploration and exploitation.
Selection, valuation and strategic decision-making is their
responsibility. &amp; Generativity is supported by search-based processes to
discover missing alternatives hidden by bounded rationality. Foolishness
or simple landscape searching can uncover unbounded rational
alternatives. The overall product development process tends to be
by-product of the ambidextrous organization. &amp; The environment offers
the alternatives to the decision-maker and seeker. High levels of
flexibility and capabilities are required to respond quickly enough to
changes. Search-based behaviour help to prepare and build up
capabilities to cope with the environment. &amp; The firm should balance its
organization structurally, sequentially or contextually (different
levels of the system) to support exploration and exploitation regimes.
Ambidextrous organizations are the norm, and the careful balance is
chosen depending on the environment dynamics observability.</p>
<h4 id="interactive-model-enabling-an-ecology-of-generativity">Interactive model: enabling an ecology of generativity</h4>
<p>The interactive model approaches the issue in a far more contingent way.
The circulation of concepts and interactions with artefacts contribute
to the exploration regime and simultaneously to the exploitation effort
as stakeholders take part in the process. The decision-making has a
tendency to be left on the back seat, as the engaging action with others
will allow addressing uncertainties and the unknown. Yet, organizing
open innovation, or freeing innovation raises the question of problem
formulation and deciding of its decomposition in the network of
interactions.
The organization boundaries can be easily blurred by the numerous
engagement of agents and artefacts with the environment. It naturally
reveals numerous question on the governance, if not control, of such
fractal organizations as the identity and purpose of the products being
developed could bring heterogeneity and incoherence.</p>
<p>to 1 &amp;
<strong>Model of coordination and collective action</strong> &amp; Generative processes &amp;
Environment cognition &amp; Organization design</p>
<p>Middle management and individuals (designers and silent designers) bear
the interactions. Spaces, occasions and artefacts should be designed.
Top management may be involved to shape networks and relationships.
Decision-making and problem framing may be required to be decomposed and
distributed by top management. &amp; Interactions between agents and
artefacts support circulation of meaning, create and manage value.
Metaphors, desirable concepts are used to drive coordination and
cohesion for radical innovation. &amp; Flexibility is supported by the
network and favours open innovation to reach out for new design
requirements. Reaching out for the full value chain and extending it to
user-designers allows shaping future environments. It is a means to
formulate and solve problems. &amp; Network and distributed design.
Open/close boundaries on multiple fronts, potentially fractal.
Organization tends to be a by-product of the product development
processes in the network.</p>
<h4 id="encapsulated-model-challenging-organization-design-and-learning">Encapsulated model: challenging organization design and learning</h4>
<p>The encapsulation of generative process into projects and the management
of a portfolio with a program elevate the interactive perspective by
putting the emphasis on strategic management, an enclose collective
action, as well as a potential issue of governance and temporary
organizations.</p>
<p>The temporary organization supporting the project-based management also
relies on functional departments providing key resources and knowledge
management. The organizational learning and organization ties of
projects floating across these organizations can induce difficulties
that encourage to think of change management with the scope of a given
project, instead of a separate activity.</p>

&amp; Practices, methods are embedded in project/program. Resources are
drawn and requested depending on novelty. &amp; Perception and action
engaged locally, at project level and with possible oversight from
program governance. Learning between projects is key to build awareness.
&amp; Projects shape temporary organizations relying on functional
departments. The boundaries move according to environment interactions
and may be governed by program management and office. Temporary
organization tends to be a by-product of the product development
processes supported by the portfolio of projects.</p>

<h2 id="research-journey">Research Journey</h2>
<p>In this section, we present the research journey over the three years
corresponding to the IRM phasing and its modalities. The researcher took
part in several Steering Committees with the firm and PhD directors, as
well as numerous Academic confrontations which have participated to the
evolution of perception of literature frameworks and gradual
specification of a new <em>rational myth</em>. The figure below gives a global
picture of the journey over several dimensions:</p>
<figure>
<img src="researchjourney.png" id="fig:researchjourney" alt="" /><figcaption>Research Journey</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="steering-committees">Steering committees</h3>
<p>In order to elaborate the different phases of IRM, several steering
committees were organized on a quarterly basis with the academic and
industrial supervisors, in addition to weekly interactions with both
separately.
The first set of meetings gave a frame for an open discussion
(<em>isonomy</em>) around a proposed model of action, framework projected over
the data collected on several case studies. Presentations and
discussions allowed testing hypothesis, different narratives, and
semantics taken from literature models. Two major meetings were
organized with the CTO, R&amp;T, engineering and business development
managers, in addition to PhD Directors. Otherwise 10 other steering
committees were held with the CTO and PhD supervisors to keep track of
the <em>open management issue</em>.
The second set of meetings were perhaps less formal as the challenge was
to update PhD supervisors as frequently as possible on the collected
data and analysis made. In a more personal way, it was the occasion for
the research to test extreme hypothesis or simple extrapolations in
order to explore the boundaries of the domain of the models taken from
the literature or grounded in the data. Practically, it implied testing
narratives, semantics from different literature streams to test how the
supervisors would project themselves in the understanding built by the
researcher. It is a dual learning process for both sides.</p>

<h3 id="evolution-of-the-rational-myth-contributors">Evolution of the <em>rational myth</em> contributors</h3>
<p>In this subsection, we propose to cover the literature journey of the
researcher. We briefly present how the modelling effort came around over
which literature was mobilized, in addition which articles were
presented at conferences and sent to journals. The elaboration of the
<em>rational myth</em> and <em>set of logics portrait</em> is not a linear process. So
the following paragraphs are an <em>ex-post</em> viewpoint of the PhD journey.
We have taken the liberty to make three categories for which articles
were written and presentations made on various occasions to test
literature models on case studies.</p>
<p>As the reader will see, they do not follow the literature review
chapters
(<a href="#chap:literature1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="chap:literature1">[chap:literature1]</a>
and
<a href="#chap:literature2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="chap:literature2">[chap:literature2]</a>),
instead they follow the PhD candidate through the three years and how he
tested several frameworks to engage with academia. The researcher made a
first effort regarding the literature around the construct of
&ldquo;decision-making&rdquo; &ldquo;design thinking&rdquo; before going into the field
&ldquo;organizational ambidexterity&rdquo; and ramifications.</p>
<h4 id="decision-making">Decision-making</h4>
<p>Through the case study at ZSSM, we had the opportunity to study the
decision theories in order to explain the project management. Data was
presented in a way that it encouraged the decision-making study: the
story was told as sequences of events with commitment to decisions,
beliefs and their representation in several documents.</p>
<h5 id="rational-theories-of-choice---rational-theories-of-choice--">Rational theories of choice - [rational-theories-of-choice&ndash;]</h5>
<p>As we will see later, we proposed to test the validity of rational
models of choice, where rationality is seen as instrumental(Boudon

<a href="#ref-Boudon2012">2012</a>). Large reviews of decision theories were
executed: from the ones based on <em>maximum expected utility</em> to
modulations made between the 1950s to early 1990s with models discussing
the underlying axiomatic and formulation mathematics. The works of
Allais, Kahnmenan, Tversky, Machina, Camerer, Giocolli, Quiggin,
G.Klein, Slovic, Regenwetter and Gilboa were paramount in the field.</p>
<p>Debates on rationality, coherence between decision, beliefs and action
were covered to understand how the construct of decision-making was
considered in different literature domains ranging from economics,
management to philosophy. It was also the occasion to make a detour
through mathematics with decision models using multi-criteria approaches
and imprecise probabilities.</p>
<h5 id="irrationality-in-decision-making---irrationality-in-decision-making--">Irrationality in decision-making - [irrationality-in-decision-making&ndash;]</h5>
<p>The question of not being able to expect, changing the notion of utility
to deal with the way decisions are made, led the researcher to dive into
the way what makes irrationality and how the decisions are constructed.
So the perspective of ex-post construction of decision to justify the
course of action, and deviance according instrumental rationality was
addressed.</p>
<p>Yet, as we were looking to bridge a gap with design theories, considered
as a change of paradigm, we were looking for ways in which rationality
could be preserved and still extend decision-making with design theories
without falling in the trap of leaving model-out-of-domain phenomena to
dispositional variables such as irrationality or constructs determined
by ad-hoc phenomena such as Bourdieu’s <em>habitus</em>. One could refer to the
books of Christophe Morel on absurd decisions, and the works Nils
Brunson for their perspective on irrationality and absurdity. However,
the researcher was more inspired by the works of Richard Bronk on the
importance of imagination and creativity in markets (Bronk

<a href="#ref-Bronk2009">2009</a>) as a means to propose extensions and deep
revisions of outdated models of Thought explaining Reality.</p>
<p>The last two paragraph led to an article presented at the International
Conference on Engineering Design (Le Glatin, Le Masson, and Weil

<a href="#ref-LeGlatin2017">2017</a>
<a href="#ref-LeGlatin2017">a</a>) and to a parallel
submission to CERN IdeaSquare Journal of Experimental Innovation (Le
Glatin, Le Masson, and Weil

<a href="#ref-LeGlatin2017a">2017</a>
<a href="#ref-LeGlatin2017a">b</a>) (see appendix
<a href="#chap:paper2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="chap:paper2">[chap:paper2]</a>).</p>
<h5 id="strategy-management-and-politics-of-decision-making---strategy-management-and-politics-of-decision-making--">Strategy management and politics of decision-making - [strategy-management-and-politics-of-decision-making&ndash;]</h5>
<p>Similarly, studying the role of strategy-making, strategy-as-practice,
encouraged the researcher to find ways of formalizing decisions in a
different way. The works of Crozier, Fredberg, Pettigrew, Sfez were key
to test other frameworks were the role-playing is mobilized. The
researcher discussed with Laurent Simon, who referred also to Laure
Cabantous for further debates on decision-making and emergent
strategies. The difficulty for the researcher was to make sense of the
observations. Some of decisions taken were not coherent with the course
of action or beliefs. Violations of rationality axiomatic could be
highlighted but as the outcomes were mitigated and questioned utility
and performance, a different model was to be found to add details to
known phenomena or substantiate anomalies in a novel model. A turning
point was reached with a detour through the literature of routines and
organizational ambidexterity. Indeed, stimulating papers with a
sociological perspective written by Fanny Simon and Albéric Tellier with
the <em>event system theory</em> of Frederick Morgeson and <em>event-structure
analysis</em> of Larry Griffin.</p>
<h4 id="design-thinking">Design Thinking</h4>
<p>As two case studies were based on the use of Design Thinking (DT)
methodology, in-depth literature review was conducted to understand its
origins, evolution and complementarity with other design perspectives in
literature: design studies, design theories and creativity.</p>
<h5 id="design-thinking-in-organizations---design-thinking-in-organizations--">Design Thinking in organizations - [design-thinking-in-organizations&ndash;]</h5>
<p>The place of a creativity methods, supporting the Fuzzy Front End and a
subsequent efficient NPD, has been largely studied in the past decades
starting with creative problem solving, brainstorming, and more recently
with Design Thinking methodology. Since it came through practice mainly,
several academics starting in d.schools (Stanford and Potsdam) but also
Swedish researcher centres, worked towards positioning DT with respect
to engineering, creativity and innovation management and organization
studies also.</p>
<p>However, as design in general is usually seen as a confined activity
confined to engineering, or perhaps strategy, or even organizational
design, several barriers were faced when trying to framing and valuing
DT as part of an ecology of routines in the organization.</p>
<h5 id="design-theory-and-engineering---design-theory-and-engineering--">Design Theory and engineering - [design-theory-and-engineering&ndash;]</h5>
<p>From the perspective of design theory, design science, and engineering,
reaching out for their impact of the organization was not a easy task.
But, as the field appeared more structured, it helped as reference to
position DT and try to reach out for organizational issues.</p>
<h5 id="design-oriented-organization---design-oriented-organization--">Design-Oriented Organization - [design-oriented-organization&ndash;]</h5>
<p>In the tradition of works of design theories and the importance of
management devices in organization, embracing post-Simonian paradigm,
the works of design-oriented organizations for innovative capabilities
(Andy Dong, Armand Hatchuel). They place design as a generalized
activity taking place at all levels of the organized, hence requiring to
be carefully managed to sustain firm’s regeneration.
This literature complements existing literature on dynamic capabilities
and organizing for radical innovation (O’Connor, Dougherty, Leonard) but
also the contributing organizational routines needed to support these:
knowledge management, valuation, power and legitimacy.</p>
<p>The last three paragraph led to an article presented at 6th Creative
Innovation Management Community Workshop at University of Potsdam
d.school (Le Glatin, Le Masson, and Weil 
<a href="#ref-LeGlatin2016">2016</a>). The
latter was adapted after having some input of several researchers for a
submission at Creative Innovation Management Journal. The paper had
taken different frameworks in the literature whilst trying to bridge the
difficulty to link design theory literature with organization, and catch
Design Thinking in between. The editorial along with the reviewer
highlighted several weaknesses of the paper and asked to resubmit. After
several months of maturation, the researcher had the opportunity to
engage discussion with one of the editorial board members. Katharina
Hölzle insight was crucial and we realized we are addressing the same
issue despite the PhD candidate’s clumsy writing. Therefore, an extended
abstract had been submitted for the R&amp;D Conference in Milano (2018), and
the re-writing of a full article for the conference (Le Glatin et al.

<a href="#ref-LeGlatin2018">2018</a>) but also for a clean resubmission to CIM
Journal (see appendix
<a href="#chap:paper1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="chap:paper1">[chap:paper1]</a>).</p>
<h4 id="organizational-ambidexterity">Organizational ambidexterity</h4>
<p>As mentioned earlier, in the same way that the duality between
market-pull and techno-push was first addressed by the research project,
the researcher inquired on the model of ambidexterity. The motivation
for such topic started when trying to formalize a portfolio of case
studies, and projects observed at the intra/inter-BU level.</p>
<h5 id="organizational-perspective---organizational-perspective--">Organizational perspective - [organizational-perspective&ndash;]</h5>
<p>These projects were hard to label in the organizations. The belonging
and having appropriate management tools appeared critical to
interviewees and attendees of the PhD steering committees. They
acknowledged that projects all along where not fully exploration nor
fully exploitation. Consequently, the researcher looked for literature
items that would touch upon this grey zone contributing to strategy and
competitive advantage. Luckily, in recent years (2013-2015), several
authors such as Tushmann, Birkinshaw, O’Reilly pointed towards the
necessity to study decision-making and managerial capabilities to better
understand the translation of ambidexterity at a micro-level, beyond top
management and environment perspectives.</p>
<h5 id="exploration-vsexploitation-of-routines---exploration-vs-exploitation-of-routines--">Exploration vs. exploitation of routines - [exploration-vs.-exploitation-of-routines&ndash;]</h5>
<p>Since ambidexterity can be approached in two main different ways.
Besides the organizational one, the other stresses the nature of
routines and they should be coordinated in a global way for
organizational learning. In 1991, March’s proposes a more behavioural
approach by considering problem-solving, theories of choice,
evolutionary theory and information-processing. This echoes the
decision-making issues mentioned earlier with an <em>a priori</em>
irrationality. The cases encouraged to conceptualize the possibility of
switching between modes, but also to find a middle ground avoiding the
dichotomy. In other words, a new kind of rationality where absurdities
and anomalies can be resolved, hence blurring the artificial separation
between exploration and exploitation or even forcing them to be over a
same continuum.</p>
<h5 id="project-management---project-management--">Project Management - [project-management&ndash;]</h5>
<p>Finally, during the last stretch of the PhD journey, we reached out to
project management literature. Recent research on exploration project
management and the role of the unknown in such situation, have amended
the literature with new ways of addressing the tension between
exploration and exploitation. The works of Loch and Lenfle are now a
cornerstone in the field. Since the organizational studies were key for
the research, naturally we were drawn towards the role of matrix
organization, adhocracies, and more generally
temporary-based-organization in the field of project management. It was
a means to loop back with organizational design and by which means the
organization supports these projects: resources, routines and dynamic
capabilities.</p>
<p>To test the understanding of the literature and its limitations, the
researcher also engaged in a critical presentation during a PhD Seminar
(June 2017) encouraging to clearly position the analysis and explain how
the described phenomena differs from the literature models. It was a
turning point in the journey since it encouraged the understanding of
presented anomalies and design of a new model resolving them. The notion
of <em>decisional ambidexterity</em> was clarified and extended also with the
contribution to European Management Review article (Le Masson et al.

<a href="#ref-LeMasson2018">2018</a>) (see appendix
<a href="#chap:paper4" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="chap:paper4">[chap:paper4]</a>).</p>
<p>In addition, a full article was sent to EURAM 2018 Conference (Le
Glatin, Le Masson, and Weil 
<a href="#ref-LeGlatin2018a">2018</a>) (see appendix
<a href="#chap:paper3" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="chap:paper3">[chap:paper3]</a>),
a synthesis for the Doctoral Colloquium was submitted. Finally, another
working paper will be submitted to future conferences (see appendix
<a href="#chap:paper5" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="chap:paper5">[chap:paper5]</a>).</p>
<h3 id="paper-writing-and-case-studies">Paper writing and case studies</h3>
<p>The several discussions, debates and literature reviews were key to
formalise reasoning into several papers. These are summarized and
reformulated here in the manuscript and can be extensively consulted in
the Appendix. The associated case studies are briefly presented in the
following chapter.
In the previous methodological sections, we have explained the intent to
demonstrate an anomaly. Three papers were written for this common
objective with different streams of literature. They are based on three
major cases representing the variety of innovation management. These are
presented in Table
<a href="#table:papers1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="table:papers1">[table:papers1]</a>
(p.).
Then a theoretical paper offers a model to reconcile with the anomaly.
Compared to published version (appendix
<a href="#chap:paper4" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="chap:paper4">[chap:paper4]</a>),
we propose in this manuscript an extension that is then discussed in the
last paper of this thesis (see Table
<a href="#table:papers2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="table:papers2">[table:papers2]</a>,
p.).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="role-and-position-of-the-researcher---intervention-research">Role and position of the researcher - Intervention Research</h2>
<p>In this section, we explain what were the activities and relations of
the researcher but also employee of the firm. We explain the mission of
the Innovation Direction and how the researcher took part in it. We also
cover daily activities, main drivers of integration with respect to the
management issue at stake in the research project, and peculiarities.</p>
<h3 id="being-part-of-the-innovation-direction">Being part of the Innovation Direction</h3>
<p>The Innovation Direction was created in 2013, following the creation of
the Zodiac Scientific and Technical Council (ZSTC) by Thierry
Rouge-Carrassat. He had been in charge of engineering departments and
the general management of business units. In parallel, several
discussions with the Group Human Resources benchmarked how Research &amp;
Technology or Research &amp; Development was organized. Among the surveys,
it was decided to establish an “Experts Career” program that would value
technical careers besides the traditional management one and the program
management (ZA-H-5003 Expert Technical Career Path Standard). This dual
ladder model (Allen and Katz 
<a href="#ref-Allen1986">1986</a>) was largely
inspired by the car equipment manufacturer Valéo. Thierry
Rouge-Carrassat had also previously established a dedicated R&amp;T within
business unit.
The CEO, Olivier Zarrouati had decided to create a Group Technical &amp;
Innovation Officer, and Thierry was offered the opportunity. With the
support of a consulting firm, management tools were introduced to offer
BUs means of managing the nascent dedicated R&amp;T activity. Previously,
these were part of more traditional engineering activities designing
products for client demands, but induced high risk. A separate process
and structure was proposed to mitigate risks between an
upstream/exploratory set of activities compared to more
downstream/exploitative ones taking place in client programs (new
product development).
The management tools consisted in what is almost a standard for
aeronautics after having being one for the Department of Defence in the
United States of America: Technology Readiness Level and Technology Road
maps (Mankins 
<a href="#ref-Mankins2009">2009</a>). Airbus and Boeing, in addition
to the institutions such as public funding schemes, certification
authorities have been in the past decades gradually introducing the
concept of technology readiness assessment in 9 levels. Some
discrepancies between scales can sometimes be observed such as Boeing’s
being longer one (see Boeing’s procedure PRO-5157 - Technology and
Application Readiness Criteria (Issue March 21, 2007)).</p>
<p>|m2cm|p12cm| Level &amp; Definition

<p>The researcher arrived in late July 2015 in the newly created team: a
CTO delegate for the Americas from the start in early 2014, the Director
of Intellectual Property had been recruited in October 2014 and the
Director of R&amp;T European funded programs in May 2015. An additional
member was delegated at the Institute for Technology Research in
Toulouse (<em>IRT Saint-Exupéry</em>) in charge of the department of Electrical
Systems. In the following months, an experienced project manager would
be hired to take care of a national program for metal additive layer
manufacturing, joined by a PhD candidate based in an university
laboratory in Orléans (<em>Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique
Aéronautique</em>).</p>
<p>The team was rather young in the group except for the CTO and the one
based in Toulouse, we were then all discovering the intricacies of the
group. We would share a lot of information and thoughts on what we would
discover as we held meetings across business units.
In December 14, 2015, team’s mission was defined, despite all being
already being autonomous in their functions (project management, patent
management, funding and R&amp;T management support):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lead the development of a long term technological vision with
associated tools &amp; processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage efficiently the expertise and IP, develop relevant internal &amp;
external partnerships and secure funding to ensure a sustainable
road map</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lead the development of a long term technological vision with an
associated sustainable road map</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage efficiently the expertise and IP, develop relevant internal &amp;
external partnerships and secure funding by applying required tools
&amp; processes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="phd-candidate-in-innovation-management-position">PhD Candidate in Innovation Management position</h4>
<p>The researcher would report to the CTO as he would potentially benefit
from the feedback from field work, analyses and model creation and
testing. Bi-weekly meetings were organized to keep track of what the
researcher was conducting, and potentially answer to his questions and
test hypothesis.
On several occasions, the PhD Candidate took some of the CTO’s tasks.
These were quite varied but all served the research project in some way
or another. The table
<a href="#tab:side_activities" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:side_activities">[tab:side_activities]</a>
offers a glimpse of the different activities (see below).</p>
<p>|p3cm|p12cm| Activities &amp; Description
TRL procedure &amp; <em>October-January 2016</em> - Support Zodiac Seats France to
implement the TRL assessment procedure and the management of technology
handover between R&amp;T and Development Engineering activities.
Appropriation of the definitions given in the existing group procedures
was mandatory and required further details and adaption to the local
engineering context. The several workshop days organized for the R&amp;T and
Development Engineering departments helped the identification of a case
study. Frequent discussion with managers for innovation management
related issues, led to providing a training session on Innovative Design
methods.</p>
<p>ZAOS Program Management &amp; <em>March-July 2016</em> - Within the Zodiac
Aerospace Operation System launched in 2016 as part of the Quality
Management system. It established a common baseline for all business
units to support program management activities. Several workshops were
held by Operational Excellence team and the researcher contributed to
stressing the link with R&amp;T activities. It was also the occasion to get
to know several other program managers and directors from across the
firm and gain familiarity with the program management activities</p>
<p>Strategy Management Review &amp; <em>June 2016</em> - A review for the Cabin Branch
on Technology and Product Roadmap was scheduled and the researcher
represented the CTO to collect feedback on ongoing projects and
communicate messages from the CTO</p>
<p>ZAOS Develop &amp; Sustain &amp; <em>November 2016 - March 2017</em> - In the same way
to the Program Management process, the parallel and supporting process
of Developing and Sustaining products and services was defined. A
baseline was created for all BUs and the researcher took the
responsibility during workshops to synthesize, challenge and write the
“Design &amp; Develop” process. It was a key turning point to be fully
comfortable with the processes and BU practices. The experience
contributed to clarify the understanding of the decision-making process
and <em>rational myth</em> for development engineering activities.</p>
<p>CORAC meetings &amp; <em>November 2017 - February 2018</em> - For a topic related
to connectivity and aircraft operations, the Council for Research in
Civil Aviation (<em>Conseil pour la Recherche en Aviation Civile</em>), the CTO
invited the researcher to follow-up on these meetings where the main
French aeronautical firms propose projects contributing to the given
topics. Besides representing one of the only company relevant for
aircraft cabin equipment, the content of the meetings largely
contributing to the understanding of how firms showcase their strategy
and perception of innovation in their ecosystem.</p>
<p>ZAOS Innovate &amp; <em>November 2017 - April 2018</em> - In a similar way to
Program Management and Develop &amp; Sustain processes, a new set of
procedures were defined to fit the ZAOS framework. The researcher took
the lead of the activities dedicated to technology roadmaps and
innovation management, to propose extensions of earlier versions of
procedures based on the case studies analyses and research journey.</p>
<p>R&amp;T Managers meeting &amp; A colleague of Zodiac Interconnect Europe
launched a series of meeting dedicated to share practices, issues and
knowledge on technology domains for R&amp;T managers based in France. The
researcher participated to these meetings to discuss their topics,
present and test hypotheses built during the last year of the PhD
journey.</p>
<h3 id="first-steps-and-gaining-autonomy">First steps and gaining autonomy</h3>
<p>From August to November 2015, the time was dedicated to gain
acquaintance with several business units, understand the purpose of the
Technical and Innovation Direction, as well as try to reveal potential
<em>open management issues</em> for case studies supporting the research
project.</p>
<h4 id="being-introduced-by-the-cto">Being introduced by the CTO</h4>
<p>The first month was fully dedicated to open discussions with several
managers (engineering, marketing, sales), technical experts and project
managers part of the middle management of BUs across the group. Meetings
were held in the corporate headquarters in Plaisir where several BU
representatives have offices, as well as several other
video-conferences.
The CTO had sent an email introducing the researcher’s PhD project to
the ZSTC community, as well as key experts and managers who have a
rather dense network within their business unit or across others. In
total, 15 employees were consulted. Not all of them contributed equally
to data collection. They were from 8 different business units all from
middle management and Direction committees.
The researcher received a warm welcome from all interviewees who were
curious in finding what he could bring to their daily concerns. As these
first meetings were quite open, the setting was about having them tell
stories about their work, their projects, difficulties, good practices
and general management topics. They were in a favourable setting to
disclose valuable signals feeding a <em>feeling of discomfort</em> guiding the
<em>rational myth</em> sensing.</p>
<h4 id="first-intervention-trl-assessment-tool">First intervention: TRL assessment tool</h4>
<p>As the researcher was gradually being identified, recognized in the R&amp;T
community, the R&amp;T Manager of Zodiac Seats France (ZSFR) reached out for
support on the implementation of the TRL assessment, before
reconsidering the TRM structuring. The request originated from a demand
of funding scheme who steers carefully the progress of portfolio of
projects. TRL targets had been given and several debates occurred on the
understanding of their definitions, so they needed support on providing
accuracy to definition baseline given in the ZA procedure and justify
the TRL assessment through a proper tool.
Four workshops were organized with the support and input of the CTO for
the first meetings. The researcher had benchmarked several business
units beforehand following the round of open interviews, and other
aeronautical firms for examples of TRL assessment use. Based on the
latter, a draft created by the researcher served as a basis for
discussions with R&amp;T stakeholders at ZSFR to propose an update TRL
assessment tool.
A by-product of this intervention, a new ZA procedure was re-issued to
share the updated baseline definition with detailed tool to support
other BUs. The TRL was seen as an evaluation and not necessarily
associated with gates to be passed. Such perspective fed many debates on
the maturity assessment of systems or designs since technologies would
be integrated in a given product at some point. Thus, it also encouraged
the revision of the complementary procedure on <em>Technology Roadmap
definition, creation and sustaining</em> and its articulation with Product
Roadmaps.
Subsequently, the relationship established with the business unit led to
the identification of a case study on the engineering of a modular
platform for business class seat (see case description p.).</p>
<h4 id="master-courses-for-literature-frameworks">Master courses for literature frameworks</h4>
<p>In parallel to the Zodiac Aerospace integration, during the months of
September-October, several courses were taken in the Design Engineering
curriculum of Mines ParisTech organized by the chair of Design Theory
and Methods for Innovation to confirm learnings on design theories,
innovation management, epistemology of management sciences and
organization studies.
These courses were taken in the perspective of gaining robustness over
certain topics related to the <em>feeling of discomfort</em> originated from
the open management issues faced during the first set of open
interviews. It was also a means of trying different <em>set of logics
portraits</em> to explain first batch of observations and further
observations through <em>intervention and interaction</em> in the form of case
studies.</p>
<h4 id="surveying-bus-for-topics">Surveying BUs for topics</h4>
<p>As explained briefly, a first intervention was the opportunity to
identify a first case study at Zodiac Seats France on the engineering
design of a modular platform of business class seat. The rest of case
studies were mostly identified following the first interviews and
validation with the CTO. He played an important role in challenging the
interest of the case studies and serve as liaison with the managers at
stake.
For instance, the case identified at Zodiac Sensing and Systems
Management (ZSSM, former Intertechnique, and now called Zodiac Fuel and
Control Systems) came around as the CTO proposed to study a case of a
technology developed from scratch, above TRL6 and about to be integrated
in a Boeing aircraft program. The intent was to study a case of success
despite numerous difficulties along the way. A first interview was set
with the R&amp;T Manager. The history of the project was told, but the
narrative did not reflect anything special besides collaboration issues
with Boeing and unfavourable conjecture due to commercial litigation
concerning other ZA business units. However, the manager had mentioned
another potential case study he quickly presented. The researcher looked
for feedback from the CTO and concurred to the idea that this other case
would perhaps reveal more stimulating management issues than the bumpy
road of the other project’s trajectory. Another interview was set to dig
deeper and try to grasp the manager’s motivation (see case description
p.).
In another case, the CTO introduced the researcher to the Airbus
Development Team for on-going projects and invited him to several other
meetings held by the Executive Committee to follow up on the concepts,
projects and several debates related to the activity domain and
associated innovation management issues (see case description p.).
The regular attendance to Executive Committee meetings for strategic
technologies and product/service concepts (see case description of
Multi-BU meetings p.) also led to the acquaintance of other managers who
had a deep interest in understanding the performance and success of
their ongoing projects (see case description p.)
The CTO’s guidance through bi-weekly meetings focused on discussing the
researcher’s analysis, modelling, and collected data. These interactions
were key for the research trajectory in addition to the autonomy of the
researcher having built his relations/network across business units.</p>
<h4 id="end-of-phd-and-autonomy">End of PhD and autonomy</h4>
<p>During the second half of the PhD, as several case studies were ended
but required further analysis and modelling, the researcher had already
established regular contact with several R&amp;T Managers or Director of
Engineering. Naturally, the researcher was requested for his
contributions to TRL assessment and TRM definition, as well as
procedures written for the Zodiac Aerospace Operational System (ZAOS)
(see Table
<a href="#tab:side_activities" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:side_activities">[tab:side_activities]</a>).
Nonetheless, the researcher was gradually acknowledged among these
managers for his input on innovation management. For instance, the case
study and intervention for Zodiac Oxygen Systems Europe (ZOSE, see
section
<a href="#caseHypoxia" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="caseHypoxia">[caseHypoxia]</a>)
was proposed by the R&amp;T manager. He had started an internal program to
anticipate evolution and disruption of pilot oxygen masks to complement
the benchmark made by the marketing department. Creativity sessions were
considered and the researcher assisted the R&amp;T team to organize them and
capitalize on the design efforts made as well as with the evaluation. In
parallel, an internal open innovation challenge had been organized by
the ZSTC, of which one topic concerned the comfort and functions
associated to the pilot protection against the risks of hypoxia.
Consequently, the researched helped transcribing the open innovation
outcomes into an innovative design mapping based on C-K theory.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the initiated program was carried on and partially
translated into an answer to a call for partners in the European funded
program: Clean Sky 2. Airbus was leader of the topic reviewing the
future pilot oxygen mask. A team was put in place at ZOSE and started
designing concepts dealing with the ill-defined problem presented in the
program. The researcher was invited again to help formalizing the
efforts made and explain their design process. The challenge was to
gradually explain how to address highly uncertain and unknown parameters
in their design process and discussions with the principal
partner/client (Airbus).
The researcher was called to provide internal training, recognized by HR
department, for the R&amp;T department of Zodiac Seats France. The training
consisted in an introduction to design theories, design regimes and a
workshop to practice. Another example, during the PhD writing, the
researcher had the opportunity to contribute to an innovative design
initiative at Zodiac Electrical Power Systems. Beyond the design issue,
in the same way as in the ZOSE case, the researcher intervened and
tested models based on his research, as part of the process of testing
the <em>set of logics</em> and the <em>change process</em>.</p>
<h3 id="advantages-and-risks-of-intervention-research-for-the-study">Advantages and risks of intervention research for the study</h3>
<p>The position of the researcher, as an executive PhD given the CIFRE
convention, exposed him to valuable insight on open management issues
but also some potential <em>contamination</em> of data collection.</p>
<h4 id="catching-ctos-political-influence-and-complaining">Catching CTO’s political influence and complaining</h4>
<p>Being hosted at the Innovation Direction and studying the topic of
innovation management opened many doors in business units and corporate
meetings. It was quite easy to gather information during the first round
of interviews and the subsequent interactions with engineers, designers
and managers, as well as interventions in business units.
On some rare occasions, some interviews were hard to manage as the
speech being held was very negative (complaining). The dialogue had to
be redirected towards proposing solutions, alternatives or different
management philosophy to deal with. And sometimes, the closeness to the
CTO was tentatively tried to put a word or find backup. Of course, these
are dimensions of daily life in organizations and reflect a certain
situation, but for the role of the researcher, it can complicate the
activity of separating a clean analysis from one that is contaminated by
potential superfluous details. For instance, the question of
irrationality and absurdity of decisions or lack of understanding of
strategies of some managers were hard cases that could have been quickly
put into the quarantine of useless collected data. Yet, the role of the
researcher is to propose hypotheses, new models that can explain Reality
and be predictive in some way.</p>
<h4 id="being-consulted-for-multiple-and-varied-topics">Being consulted for multiple and varied topics</h4>
<p>As mentioned, in a previous section on gaining autonomy, the researcher
had new opportunities to study cases, following Jacques Girin’s
&ldquo;opportunistic methodology&rdquo; and also introduced in the comprehensive
methodology as expressed by Hervé Dumez.
For instance, as new procedures had been written by the researcher for
the TRL assessment, the Internal Audit Team quite often relied on him to
provide appropriate recommendations to BUs. It was the occasion for the
researcher to bring additional information when interacting the
concerned R&amp;T manager and try to probe the field in search for critical
events, shifts in their speech, or simply new projects catching one’s
attention: new design/technology embarking a organizational change.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="chapter-synthesis">Chapter synthesis</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we have presented the research journey over the last
three years. We covered how intervention research was implemented at
Zodiac Aerospace emphasizing the different movements of participating to
the firm’s activities, studying them and also gaining in reflexivity
with academic activities including meetings, seminars, presentations,
conferences and article writing.</p>
<p>Besides the overarching research methodology, the literature review
highlighted several limitations and potential anomaly which were partly
confirmed through several interactions and difficulties faced by the
researcher in his academic interactions. We proposed how to address the
anomaly and the associate effort to name and model the novel phenomenon.
We put to the fore descriptors and synthetics models (adaptive,
interactive and encapsulated) to instrument the anomaly detection.</p>
<p>Finally, we have also indicated several other activities of the
researcher in the firm and how fruitful the environment and interactions
were to facilitate the original research agenda and disentangle the
<em>open management issue</em> with colleagues concerned by the topic.</p>

<p>Translation by the researcher: &ldquo;L’ordre des sensibilités ne suit
pas nécessairement les traits saillants, ce qu’on pourait appeler le
<em>relief dynamique de notre expérience</em>. On est bien en effet peu
d’accord sur la simplification du phénomène préalable à tout
développement scientifique. On croit que les caractères primordiaux
ressortent d’eux-mêmes et s’imposent à notre étude par la seule
force de leur généralité. Parfois cependant, c’est l’accident et non
le général qui est principe d’explication au point qu’il faut
renverser les problèmes pour restituer la généralité à des
caractères phénoménaux que l’esprit avait schématisés dans un sens
spécial.&rdquo; <a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
