          <h1>Chapter 1 - Elucidating models of ambidexterity and their boundaries for innovation management</h1>

          <div class="article-style">
            <p>In this first chapter of literature review, we propose to start
discussing the seminal paper by James Gardner March published in
<em>Organization Science</em> in 1991 entitled: &ldquo;Exploration and exploitation
in organizational learning&rdquo; (James G March 
<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>). We,
of course, put this article into perspective with the flourishing
streams of literature which have rooted their assumptions in the
problem-based and decision-making background mobilized by J.March.</p>
<p>The introduction of the manuscript highlighted that the streams of
literature of organizational ambidexterity could be revisited by
developments in innovation management, such as exploration project
management. This preliminary assumption is induced by the limitations
raised by several authors in the field of ambidexterity, specially on
the how to achieve such model (Birkinshaw and Gupta

<a href="#ref-Benner2015">2015</a>).
And it is also backed up by the organization studies dimension
challenging project management (Sydow, Lindkvist, and Defillippi

<a href="#ref-Sydow2004">2004</a>; Bakker et al. 
<a href="#ref-Bakker2016">2016</a>;

<a href="#ref-Soderlund2014">2014</a>; Söderlund and Müller

<a href="#ref-Lenfle2017">2017</a>; Davies, Manning, and Söderlund 
<a href="#ref-Davies2018">2018</a>).</p>
<p>The several challenges, in the literature briefly discussed so far,
point at the tensions and fuzziness at the crossroads of innovation
management and organizational studies. More precisely, the original
assumptions of <em>exploration vs. exploitation</em> for organization learning
and adaptation may be now in conflict with the engines of innovation:
managing the unknown through project management. The unknown has gained
ground over time up to the point where models of ambidexterity may no
longer be valid. It is this interaction between ambidexterity and the
unknown that will guide our literature review. We are keen on
understanding what happens at the potential edges of ambidexterity’s
validity domain. We propose then to start anew with the foundational
paper (James G March 
<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>) on which literature piled
up.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>The notion of exploration and exploitation were typified in the
well-defined situation of problem-solving and associated decisions to
balance off these two constructs for organizational learning and firm
competition for survival and primacy. The first section <a href="#balancing-exploration-vs-exploitation-an-incomplete-model" title="Balancing exploration vs. exploitation: an incomplete model?">1</a> elaborates on the model and its boundaries as defined by J.March.

<p>The second section  <a href="#organizational-ambidexterity-organizing-unbounded-problem-solving" title="Organizational ambidexterity: organizing unbunded problem-solving">2</a> discusses the latter with the emergence of the <em>organizational ambidexterity</em> construct and prescription of organizational designs

<h2 id="balancing-exploration-vs-exploitation-an-incomplete-model">Balancing exploration vs. exploitation: an incomplete model?</h2>
<p>In (James G March 
<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>), James March presents a model supporting a Schumpeterian view of a firm’s sustainability with an organizational learning perspective: exploiting old certainties or exploring new possibilities. The firm is described as a system, where choices are made within the organization to engage in exploration or exploitation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[..] maintaining an appropriate balance between exploration and
exploitation is a primary factor in system survival and prosperity.</em>
(James G March 
<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>, 71)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The trade-off discussion is developed with a reference point taken in
rational models of choice. A decision problem is then composed of: a set
of states of nature $S$ from which consequences are envisioned $X$ with
associated probabilities $\mu$, a cost function $c:x\in X \rightarrow y\in\mathbb{R}^+$ and the decision-maker is requested to build up decision function $d:s\in S \rightarrow x\in X$.
Several axioms are necessary to support the theory depending on the model used, and the simplest version can be found in (Wald 
<a href="#ref-Wald1945a">1945</a>, 
<a href="#ref-Wald1949">1949</a>), corresponding to basis on which (Savage 
<a href="#ref-Savage1954">1954</a>) and (Raiffa 
<a href="#ref-Raiffa1968">1968</a>) have developed in management education (Giocoli 
<a href="#ref-Giocoli2013">2013</a>; Fourcade and Khurana

<a href="#ref-Fourcade2013">2013</a>).
But before considering the decisional dimension, it is worth noting the
conception of action: problems <em>appear</em> to the agent, who then
calculates accordingly given previous statistical learning from the past
and additional information available on the spot. The calculation is
seen as suboptimal given the limited/bounded rationality of the agent
and the collective in an organizational context (Simon

<a href="#ref-Simon1955">1955</a>). The organizational behaviour is then focalized
on the agent, its beliefs and interactions with others and available
information. It allows then envisioning the contribution to the
performance and survival of the firm as beliefs evolve and the
environment changes.</p>
<p>These features have been stressed in a recent review literature
published in <em>Strategic Organization</em> (Wilden et al.

<a href="#ref-Wilden2018">2018</a>) among other evolutions of the constructs of
<em>exploration</em> and <em>exploitation</em> following March’s seminal article. With
an exhaustive dataset and data-mining methods, they have observed the
evolution of the range of keywords initially proposed by March for
exploration and exploitation (see
Fig.<a href="#fig:explorationkeywords" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:explorationkeywords">1</a>
and
<a href="#fig:exploitationkeywords" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:exploitationkeywords">2</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exploration includes things captured by terms such as search,
variation, risk taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery,
innovation.</em></p>
<p><em>Exploitation includes such things as refinement, choice, production,
efficiency, selection, implementation, execution.</em> (James G March

<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>, 71)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The review points out the notion exploration has gained more attention:
please note the difference in scale (y-axis), it is astonishing! It
reinforces the importance of exploration to balance out biases of
exploitation, but we should also keep in mind that exploitation should
also be maintained to a certain extent (Birkinshaw and Gupta

<a href="#ref-Birkinshaw2013">2013</a>). Co-existence is key to the performance and
survival of the firm.</p>

<p>In (Wilden et al. 
<a href="#ref-Wilden2018">2018</a>), they show the trade-off
dilemma has drifted across several clusters of management literature
with a recent emphasis on ambidexterity, organizational structure and
performance (see section 
<a href="#balancing-exploration-vs-exploitation-an-incomplete-model" title="Balancing exploration vs. exploitation: an incomplete model?">2</a>)
and innovation management (see section 
<a href="#deciding-to-innovate-micro-foundations-of-ambidextrous-organizations" title="Deciding to innovate: micro-foundations of ambidextrous organizations?">3</a>)
Several calls for future research are made to contribute to reconsider
the organizational behaviour roots, extensiveness and micro-foundations
of the constructs of exploration/exploitation, and their articulation
with organizational boundaries (e.g. intra-organizational or across
organizations).</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    These issues are discussed in the following sections. But before
starting to discuss the topics raised in the literature, we propose in
the following paragraphs to question the underlying hypotheses made on
exploration and exploitation. We focus then on the separation enforced
between the two and how it contributes to organizational learning,
behaviours at work and the issue of sustaining the balance for
performance and survival.
  </div>

<h3 id="adaptive-processes-supporting-organizational-learning">Adaptive processes supporting organizational learning</h3>
<p>The adaptive processes that are framed by <em>given</em> problems will call for
numerous mechanisms ranging from &ldquo;rational models of choice&rdquo;, &ldquo;theories
of limited rationality&rdquo;, &ldquo;organizational learning and evolutionary
models of organizational forms and technologies&rdquo; (James G March

<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>, 72). Within the information-processing paradigm,
the notion of &ldquo;search&rdquo; is mobilized to understand to which extent
decisions should be made to consider <em>given</em> alternatives and available
information to organization action. As it is stressed, the decision
model is quickly jeopardized with the observational capacity of the
agent not being able to acknowledge new alternatives, sure thing
principle<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, or uncontrolled externalities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The problem is complicated by the possibilities that new investment
alternatives may appear, that probability distributions may not be
stable, or that they may depend on the choices made by others</em> (James
G March 
<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>, 72).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This unobservability reinforces the limitation to adaptive process which
should be optimized because of bounded rationality and theories of
satisfying (Simon 
<a href="#ref-Simon1955">1955</a>) in addition to anchoring
effects and other cognitive biases revealed by the works of Amos Tversky
and Daniel Kahneman in their prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky

<a href="#ref-Kahneman1979a">1979</a>; Tversky and Kahneman

<a href="#ref-Tversky1974">1974</a>). In the field of theories addressing the
unknown, to go beyond available information and knowledge, theories of
creativity with the support of cognitive psychology have emphasized
similar phenomena: fixation effects (Smith, Ward, and Schumacher

<a href="#ref-Smith1993">1993</a>; Ward 
<a href="#ref-Ward2007">2007</a>). But the bridge
remains to be built between these two separate fields of research where
theories and experimentations means do not yet synergize.
The targets associated with the problem (pre-)framing define a reference
frame to value learning and knowledge management. Organizational
learning has stressed the importance of <em>refining</em> alternatives and
<em>inventing</em> new ones. Exploration precedes or augments exploitation and
will have antagonistic effects on the performance of decision-making
(e.g. skills improvement to execute existing alternatives)(Levinthal and
March 
<a href="#ref-Levinthal1981">1981</a>). This viewpoint on learning
performance preconceives its criteria and the organizational ties
between the exploration and exploitation regimes. It tends to hide the
complexities associated with multi-scale phenomena at the individual,
social and organizational levels as specified by J.March himself on
balancing out the two regimes. Organizing an appropriate decision
balancing exploration and exploitation becomes critical.
In the tradition of adaptive process, the proposal from evolutionary
theories introducing the notions of <em>variation</em> and <em>selection</em> is then
quite seducing. J.March describes the purpose of these regimes and
limitations by proposing the garbage-can decision process as a reservoir
to protect from externalities and the unknown(Eisenhardt and Zbaracki

<a href="#ref-Eisenhardt1992">1992</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Effective selection among forms, routines, or practices is essential
to survival, but so also is the generation of new alternative
practices, particularly in a changing environment.</em> (James G March

<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>, 72)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The adaptation speed and the prior exploration/exploitation of
appropriate practices will make a difference in the environment. Again,
a structural or a sequential view of managing exploration and
exploitation is suggested to take place at different levels: individual,
organizational and social. For the organizational learning perspective,
the interactions between individuals and the organization, and the
competition for primacy between organizational (sub-)groups will
contribute to the exploration/exploitation trade-off and vice-versa. The
presented model is robust enough to cover several streams of literature
and include some of the multi-scale complexity.
Now, on the value of both regimes, J.March gives further indications on
the necessity to separate them. Exploration is presented as a sacrifice
and vulnerable because of overarching performance criteria derived from
exploitation. The exploration valuation framework is
exploitation-driven, as if on the same continuum:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Compared to returns from exploitation, return from exploration are
systematically less certain, more remote in time, and organizational
more distance from the locus of action and adaption.</em> (James G March

<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>, 73)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It reinforces the antagonistic effects of deciding of the
allocation/division of resources to one of the regimes. The exploitation
reference point also complexifies the understanding and efficiency of
exploration during its refinement towards exploitation. Exploration is
pictured as rather complex and fuzzy, highly uncertain and should be
transformed into more systematic regime, like exploitation to perform
better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Reason inhibits foolishness; learning and imitation inhibit
experimentation. This is not an accident but is a consequence of the
temporal and spatial proximity of the effects of exploitation, as well
as their precision and interconnectedness.</em> (James G March

<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>, 73)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These views tend to emphasize paradoxically the orthogonality of
exploration activities with respect to exploitation still triggering
antagonistic effects for a given performance valuation reference. At the
light of this model we could synthesize in the figure below:</p>





  











<figure id="figure-schematics-of-exploration-and-exploitation-trade-off">

<p>Despite hiding several details of the model, the figure highlights the
adaptation perspective and the learning required channelling the
organization at the light of changes in the environment. It is a
temporal representation, but it could also be picture in parallel,
showing exploration oriented in certain directions usually blinded by
exploitation.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>We ask several questions echoing the limitations mentioned by J.March
and the exhaustive literature review (Wilden et al.
<a href="#ref-Wilden2018">2018</a>) relative to the learning mechanisms and
experimentation (discovery). The search-based model should enable
reaching full rationality in opposition to its boundedness. As suggested
in (James G March <a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>), foolishness could be driving
force. We must then clarify the behaviours, their categories with
respect to problem-solving, search and decision-making.</p>
<p>Is it required to sustain the separation and balance between
exploration/exploitation? How predictable are the discovery patterns?
What are the spatial and temporal parameters to play with to balance out
ambidexterity?</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="learning-with-respect-to-foolishness-novelty-and-creative-logics">Learning with respect to foolishness, novelty and creative logics</h3>
<p>In order to study learning mechanisms, James March along with other
great researchers have extensively studied the sociology of
organizations and some, if not most, have taken a close look at
engineering activities (Dong, March, and Workiewicz

<a href="#ref-Dong2017">2017</a>, 8). Engineering departments among other functions
in the firm have created over decades design and engineering rules, set
of established practices required to support product development and
manufacturing. Engineering has been one of the major epicentre of
novelty and also the baseline for daily exploitation. It is a place of
tension and balance for exploration and exploitation regimes. Learning,
imitation and forms of rationalization are deployed in such context to
sustain exploitation regime. The knowledge management gravitates around
and deals with the established rational model organizing collective
action.</p>
<p>In an evolutionary perspective, efficiency can be improved with a better
selection with respect to the production of such engineering
organizations. Imitation is one sub-activity with the risk of converging
on sub-optimal selections. Ways of controlling this convergence must be
envisioned such as bringing novel knowledge, or in a network theory
perspective, slightly disconnecting agents (Dong, March, and Workiewicz

<a href="#ref-Dong2017">2017</a>, 8). Encouraging novelty becomes critical and
J.March recalls that most novelties fail, leading to the promotion of
the garbage-can decision model appropriate for unstable environment
paired with a selection process. Benefits of others experimentation can
also be drawn fostering vicarious learning (Riedl and Seidel

<a href="#ref-Riedl2016">2016</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If you’re going to engineer an evolutionary process, you have to work
on improving selection, and you have to work on improving novelty.</em>
(Dong, March, and Workiewicz 
<a href="#ref-Dong2017">2017</a>, 9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Novelty is odd and uncertain, and this failure rate calls for some
<em>technologies of foolishness</em> by opposition to exploitation behaviours
ruled by established technologies of model-based rationality (March

<a href="#ref-March2006">2006</a>; Dong, March, and Workiewicz

<a href="#ref-Dong2017">2017</a>). Rational models have misspecified the
organization of action due to numerous difficulties: uncertainty and the
unexpected (Shackle 
<a href="#ref-Shackle1949">1949</a>), causal complexity,
preference ambiguity (Slovic 
<a href="#ref-Slovic1995">1995</a>; Camerer,
Loewenstein, and Rabin 
<a href="#ref-Camerer2004">2004</a>) and strategic
interaction (Pettigrew 
<a href="#ref-Pettigrew1977">1977</a>; Eisenhardt and
Zbaracki 
<a href="#ref-Eisenhardt1992">1992</a>; Chia 
<a href="#ref-Chia1994">1994</a>) just
to name a few. So, other models with feedback means have developed to
adapt continuously, to counteract myopic behaviours (Levinthal and March

<a href="#ref-Levinthal1993">1993</a>) and surprise effects associated to
incompleteness of previously mentioned models of rationality. Yet, these
models may not reach a global optimum (Brehmer 
<a href="#ref-Brehmer1980">1980</a>;
Carroll and Harrison 
<a href="#ref-Carroll1994">1994</a>; Barron and Erev

<a href="#ref-Barron2003">2003</a>).</p>
<p>These problem-based modelling approaches will frame the behaviour of the
algorithm with certain boundaries and will not facilitate discovery of
other domains. We can all picture a robot hitting a wall in a infinite
loop with the hope to minimize the distance to the objective behind the
wall despite having numerous sensors. Limitations of the agent bound its
rationality because of numerous biases, but also the environment minors
the performance of adaptive processes for being too complex, endogenous,
subjective and contested (March 
<a href="#ref-March2006">2006</a>, 205).
Experimentation is then required to put the robot in a position where
novelty can be observed and gradually understood given pre-conceived
rules. In that perspective, the novelty-search algorithms (Nguyen,
Yosinski, and Clune 
<a href="#ref-Nguyen2015">2015</a>) applied for robots to adapt
like animals in a resilience mode (Cully et al. 
<a href="#ref-Cully2015">2015</a>).
This sets the frontier of problem-solving perspective and possible
decisions, but leaves potential ones undiscovered due to bounded
rationality.</p>
<p>The complexity rises when considering unusual experiences compared to
existing knowledge basis and rational model as discussed in by Raghu
Garud with a narrative perspective (Garud, Dunbar, and Bartel

<a href="#ref-Garud2011">2011</a>). In the following extract, J.March plays with
the edges of the model and the necessity to <em>generate variety</em>, but we
can expect this generativity is limited to the landscape of bounded
rationality and search:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The first central requirement of adaptation is a reproductive process
that replicates successes. The attributes associated with survival
need to be reproduced more reliably than the attributes that are not.
The second central requirement of an adaptive process is that it
generate variety.</em> (March 
<a href="#ref-March2006">2006</a>, 205)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, creative logics or generative processes in a broader and weaker
sense (Epstein 
<a href="#ref-Epstein1990">1990</a>, 
<a href="#ref-Epstein1999">1999</a>) are
required to bring variety to the process and add up to the existing
knowledge (bounded and unbounded). But again, it goes beyond
search/discovery and is rather associated with novelty and the reaching
for the unknown.
Exploration regime in its quest for variation, requires alternative
mechanisms such as organizational slack, randomness, <em>errors</em> of
adaptive process parameters and other mechanisms shifting the
performance frontier with objectives derived from intuition of a leader.
J.March makes then a case for foolishness and some <em>kind</em> of
irrationality compared to the normative technologies of rationality
established in the organization:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The designers of adaptive systems often proclaim a need for
deliberately introducing more of them to supplement exploration. In
their organizational manifestations, they advocate such things as
foolishness, brainstorming, identity-based avoidance of the structures
of consequences, devil’s advocacy, conflict, and weak memories
(George, 1980; George and Stern, 2002; Sutton, 2002). They see
potential advantages in organizational partitioning or cultural
isolation, the creation of ideological, informational, intellectual,
and emotional islands that inhibit convergence to a single world view
(March, 2004). Whereas the mechanisms of exploitation involve
connecting organizational behaviour to revealed reality and shared
understandings, the recommended mechanisms of exploration involve
deliberately weakening those connections.</em> (March

<a href="#ref-March2006">2006</a>, 207)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The numerous failures of rational models and their technologies are
<em>utopian</em> (March 
<a href="#ref-March2006">2006</a>, 209):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It is argued that the link between rationality and conventional
knowledge keeps rational technologies reliable but inhibits creative
imagination. This characterization seems plausible, but it probably
underestimates the potential contribution of rational technologies to
foolishness and radical visions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It encourages then the &ldquo;heroism of foolishness&rdquo; to support exploration
and the use of technologies of rationality as a baseline to enhance
exploration, and avoids pure irrationality. This last sentence blurs the
boundaries of exploration and exploitation, let it be on the same
continuum or in two orthogonal planes. It is a thin-wall domain defined
here pushing the debate down the line of functional stupidity in
organization (Alvesson and Spicer 
<a href="#ref-Alvesson2012">2012</a>), pure
irrationality in (Brunsson 
<a href="#ref-Brunsson1982">1982</a>) and his subsequent
works, or the role of opportunism and reliability (Lumineau and Verbeke

<a href="#ref-Lumineau2016">2016</a>; Foss and Weber 
<a href="#ref-Foss2016a">2016</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exploratory foolishness may sometimes be desirable, and technologies
of rationality may be important sources of exploration; but the use of
rational technologies in complex situations is unlikely to be
sustained by the main events and processes of history.</em> (March

<a href="#ref-March2006">2006</a>, 211)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>TeThe main question we can ask ourselves so far is <strong>how collective action
should be organized in such domain of foolishness tangent to
irrationality</strong>. And not managing appears almost clearly out of question
due to the necessity to balancing the exploration regime to reach a
global optimum with an enhanced adaptive process. We have reasons to
worry as several authors have described the variety of learning
behaviours (Garcias, Dalmasso, and Sardas <a href="#ref-Garcias2015">2015</a>) at
the light of learning/performing paradox (Smith and Lewis
<a href="#ref-Smith2011">2011</a>); or even the systematic violation of management
rules contributing to learning (Mangematin et al.
<a href="#ref-Mangematin2011">2011</a>).</p>
<p>How do we articulate it with learning mechanisms and overall knowledge
management? How could we turn such <em>deviant</em> behaviour into resources or
at least start building dynamic capacities that will support innovation?
Foolishness could contribute to unbounding individual and collective
rationality, but perhaps also extend into the unknown. It remains
unclear in the model and proposals made by J.March.xt</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="shifting-the-performance-frontier-with-innovation">Shifting the performance frontier with innovation</h3>
<p>The seminal paper of 1991 review (Wilden et al. 
<a href="#ref-Wilden2018">2018</a>)
addresses two research gaps related to the re-connection with
behavioural roots and supporting capabilities required for
exploration/exploitation (Wilden et al. 
<a href="#ref-Wilden2018">2018</a>, 11):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>How do behavioural tendencies of managers, such as the risk
propensity of executives, relate to a firm’s ability to explore versus
exploit? How do individual tendencies to explore versus exploit
interact with environmental trends at the institution, industry, and
country levels?</em></p>
<p><em>How do capabilities that support exploration and exploitation emerge
and become embedded in organizational routines? Are there differences
in the dynamic capabilities required for executing exploration versus
exploitation? Which dynamic capabilities are required to overcome path
dependencies in exploitation?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we have stressed in the previous paragraphs, enhancing adaptive
processes with novelty-driven processes supporting exploration may lead
to numerous difficulties when trying to reconnect with exploitation
regime: routines, rules and practices. The nature of exploration could
otherwise fall in the domain of behaviours based on foolishness or
rationality.
In a behavioural perspective, it is crucial to understand what
facilitates the allocation of resources for such activities. The
underlying decision-making process must be clarified. Decisions are seen
as trackers and reflections of the organizational life, and some of
these are consigned into technologies of rationality. Agents in the firm
develop associated routines that are rationally bounded and they
consequently struggle to reach global optima on an objective Pareto
front as pictured in the
Fig.<a href="#fig:explorationregimes" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:explorationregimes">4</a>.
The previous subsection highlighted that agents are bounded in a biased
knowledgeable space; exploration allows them to reach statistical optima
on the Pareto front. Foolishness could perhaps contribute to the search
vector for exploration, and it remains unclear if it contributes to
generative processes broadly, into the unknown.</p>

<p>The tension created by exploration behaviours interfere with existing
routines and rational models that could be expressed in terms of
performance criteria delimiting the Pareto front: foolishness creates an
exploitation oddity, an unusual experience (Garud, Dunbar, and Bartel

<a href="#ref-Garud2011">2011</a>) that encourages to revisit the Pareto front
definition or even the performance framing (x and y axes).
Giovanni Gavetti (Gavetti 
<a href="#ref-Gavetti2012">2012</a>) pinpoints the
ability to overcome focal behavioural bounds and reach for cognitively
distant opportunities. Instead of paying attention to local collective
action, he focuses on strategic leadership that would be able to manage
such stretch. Such kind of system thinking elevated at the leadership
level would encourage to revisit the strategic agency and governance of
collective action. If one has attended J.March leadership classes or
read (March and Weil 
<a href="#ref-March2003">2003</a>), one could find such
behavioural leadership with fictional characters as Don Quixote:
foolishness benefits his journey in some ways.
The concept of behavioural strategy (Powell, Lovallo, and Fox

<a href="#ref-Powell2011">2011</a>) proposes also to integrate the views of
reductionist, pluralist and contextualist research. Despite the
attractiveness of such consolidated and holistic construct, management
requires to design concepts that explain collective action in
organizations and at best would be actionable in practice. As suggested
by the authors, it is as the crossroads we can build a comprehensive
understanding.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>So, in order to make a case for supportive capabilities required for
exploration and exploitation, and combination of both, the behavioural
perspective calls for some architectural design of adaptive systems for
the organization as mentioned by J.March. The contribution of innovative
practices, generative processes or how they are impacted remains to be
clarified. It is a limitation of the problem-based view.</p>
<p>It also invites us to deeply understand the mechanisms of both
exploration and exploitation and the associated dualism (Farjoun
<a href="#ref-Farjoun2010">2010</a>). The paradoxical tension between regimes
describes the adaptive system performance with an inverted U-shape
between the degree of adaptiveness and the frequency of turbulence of
the environment(Posen and Levinthal <a href="#ref-Posen2012">2012</a>). It
prescribes then adjustments to the organization sustaining exploration
and exploitation, and questions where and how arbitration should be
made.</p>
<p>How should be structured the firm? How does leadership should design
accordingly to support innovation and performance? What makes
exploration and what makes the tension points when exploiting its
outcomes?</p>
<p>Overall, we could say that we have two major models, one that would be
structural and another one more processual. To organize collective
action in the firm, it is also crucial to keep an eye on learning
patterns, if exploration or exploitation contributes to core rigidities
and incompetencies (Leonard-Barton <a href="#ref-Leonard-Barton1992">1992</a>;

<p>In this section, we propose to cover the stream of literature focused on
the approach to capture behavioural roots through organizational
structure and design. Some hints of this research program can be found
echoing portfolio project management or program management, and
coordination &amp; communication means deployed across the organization in
relationship with learning mechanisms when competing for primacy (James
G March 
<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>, 84):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Similarly, multiple, independent projects may have an advantage over
a single, coordinated effort. The average result from independent
projects is likely to be lower than that realized from a coordinated
one, but their right-hand side variability can compensate for the
reduced mean in a competition for primacy. The argument can be
extended more generally to the effects of close collaboration or
cooperative information exchange. Organizations that develop effective
instruments of coordination and communication probably can be expected
to do better (on average) than those that are more loosely coupled,
and they also probably can be expected to become more reliable, less
likely to deviate significantly from the mean of their performance
distributions. The price of reliability, however, is a smaller chance
of primacy among competitors.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The literature on organizational ambidexterity made the effort over
several decades to capture the relationship between the constructs of
exploration and exploitation with respect to several other observables:
different level of analysis within the firm, influence of the
environment, leadership and many more (Birkinshaw and Gupta

<a href="#ref-Birkinshaw2013">2013</a>; O’Reilly and Tushman

<a href="#ref-OReilly2013">2013</a>). The numerous variables are usually studied
through quantitative methodologies with surveys and databases.
Correlations and patterns are then derived in relationship with the
firm’s performance and innovation. Ways of organizing ambidexterity are
typified with different impacts given a set of control variables
centralizing most of debates in the field, and may have led to
contradictions because of control variables.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    We first review the different forms of organizational ambidexterity and
influence of performance and innovation, and what are the capabilities
addressed in such domains. Second, as the core issue remains the
management of competing objectives, we analyse the literature on
paradoxes and how it contributes to organizing collective action.
Finally, given the extant literature and limitations raised by the
community of researchers we come back to the underlying mechanisms and
the necessity to understand the micro-foundations of exploration and
exploitation and nuances that may have been omitted.

<h3 id="structural-sequential-and-contextual-ambidexterity">Structural, sequential and contextual ambidexterity</h3>
<p>The word &ldquo;ambidexterity&rdquo; preceded the seminal paper of (James G March

<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>) in <em>The ambidextrous organization: Designing
dual structures for innovation</em> (Duncan 
<a href="#ref-Duncan1976">1976</a>). The
concept was introduced for organization design to improve innovation
capabilities. It makes an assumption on the innovation process seen in
two sequential phases: initiation and implementation. Robert Duncan
stresses the behavioural dimensions (resistance model mainly) and the
decision-making associated to the innovation process. The so-called
<strong>structural ambidexterity</strong> is designed to facilitate the management of
ill-structured problems posed by innovation<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Given several
behavioural features analysed, three conditional rules are prescribed
for the organizational structure given the nature of innovation
(uncertainty, radicality, need). Merging the literature of dynamic
capabilities and organizational ambidexterity (O’Reilly and Tushman

<a href="#ref-OReilly2007">2007</a>) also emphasizes the importance of senior
management to oversee the trade-offs of exploration/exploitation and the
translation of <em>sensing, seizing and reconfiguring</em> (Teece

<a href="#ref-Teece2007">2007</a>). Simultaneity is achieved by the structural
organization of exploration and exploitation. The dynamic capabilities
emerge from the contribution of senior management being able to oversee
the overall reconfiguration of both regimes: a strategic intent with
clear vision and values and the necessity to have ambidextrous
leadership. This attraction for leadership and senior teams is given
because of the risk of ambiguity of capabilities (O’Reilly and Tushman

<a href="#ref-OReilly2007">2007</a>, 190):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What is needed is the identification of specific senior team
behaviours and organizational processes/routines that allow firms to
manipulate resources into new value creating strategies. Ambidexterity
as a dynamic capability is not itself a source of competitive
advantage but facilitates new resource configurations that can offer a
competitive advantage</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This way of organizing is given for high strategic importance and
operational leverage by opposition to other configurations: independent
business unit, internalization/sub-contracting and spin-off. It is an
answer to the ad-hoc/spin-out emerging business see in the innovator’s
dilemma (Christensen 
<a href="#ref-Christensen1997">1997</a>). The critical
dimension of this stream is the contribution of a potential ambidextrous
leadership from the top management and middle management (Benner and
Tushman 
<a href="#ref-Benner2003">2003</a>, 
<a href="#ref-Benner2015">2015</a>). However, its
nature and means of action are not specified.
The <strong>sequential ambidexterity</strong> approaches the question of innovation
and continuous change with. The sequential approach is more influenced
by a continuous change perspective (Brown and Eisenhardt

<a href="#ref-Brown1997">1997</a>). Brown and Eisenhardt bring the nuance of change
in a more dynamic and continuous way contrasting with punctuated
equilibrium. When considering the shift from exploration to exploitation
(the opposite is rarely mentioned), they emphasize the importance of
experimentation and light structure (<em>semi-structure</em>). It is a <em>weaker</em>
form and blending the edges of the short burst of radical/discontinuous
change in between long periods of incremental change<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Focusing on
processes and systems allows to have an alternative approach to the
structural dimension of ambidexterity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Continuously changing organizations are likely to be complex adaptive
systems with semi-structures that poise the organization on the edge
of order and chaos and links in time that force simultaneous attention
and linkage among past, present, and future. These organizations seem
to grow over time through a series of sequenced steps, and they are
associated with success in highly competitive, high-velocity
environments.</em>(Brown and Eisenhardt 
<a href="#ref-Brown1997">1997</a>, 32)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Contextual ambidexterity</strong> brought another modulation that tends to
merge the structural dimension with the punctuated equilibrium by
(Gibson and Birkinshaw 
<a href="#ref-Gibson2004">2004</a>, 209):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>contextual because it arises from features of its organizational
context. Contextual ambidexterity is the behavioural capacity to
simultaneously demonstrate alignment and adaptability across an entire
business unit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The influence of context opens up the perspective on organizational
ambidexterity by considering the boundary condition of the construct:
environment dynamics. It also moves away from the trade-off allocation
problem by <em>simultaneously develop[ing] these capacities by aligning
themselves around adaptability</em> (Gibson and Birkinshaw

<a href="#ref-Gibson2004">2004</a>, 221). The interplay between adaptability and
alignment is placed at the individual level, calling for paradoxes at
the local level, in addition to support from senior management.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>The three models described try to organize in different way the
separation and balance between exploration and exploitation. The
non-mutual conditioning is maintained: exploration and exploitation
regimes happen in sequence, in parallel and at different levels and
contexts.</p>
<p>Systematically, top management and its leadership is required to oversee
and manage the balance, in addition to enabling some level of
flexibility for transitioning dynamically. Yet, it does reveal the
actual practice and implementation.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="limitations-of-organizational-ambidexterity-models">Limitations of organizational ambidexterity models</h3>
<p>Authors have also highlighted the push from academic reviewers during
their publishing process. Their qualitative study would indeed bring
more depth to the construct of ambidexterity and separation between
exploration/exploitation. They were encouraged to embrace the literature
of organizational ambidexterity with (Birkinshaw and Gupta

<a href="#ref-Birkinshaw2013">2013</a>, 288):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Interestingly, our original focus in this paper was not on
ambidexterity per se. Our specific interest was in the tension between
an organization’s capacities for alignment and adaptability, and in
the role of organizational context to help it achieve an appropriate
level of balance between the two. In developing the paper, we came
across ambidexterity as one possible framing for our work, and we
leaned heavily on Adler and colleagues (1999) in our theorizing. But
it was actually the editor, Marshall Schminke, who had the bright idea
to describe the phenomenon we observed as contextual ambidexterity, as
distinct from the more structure-oriented approach to ambidexterity
that Duncan (1976) and Tushman and O’Reilly (1996) had described.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast to the amount of quantitative studies, the extensive
literature reviews conducted by major authors (who have contributed with
detailed qualitative or mixed studies (Benner and Tushman

<a href="#ref-Benner2003">2003</a>; Gibson and Birkinshaw 
<a href="#ref-Gibson2004">2004</a>))
in the field have called for further qualitative research and trying to
surface underlying processes supporting ambidexterity in action
(Birkinshaw and Gupta 
<a href="#ref-Birkinshaw2013">2013</a>, 332):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>How they actually do this is seldom addressed in the research on
ambidexterity but is at the core of the leadership challenge. What do
the interfaces of the old and new need to look like? How can leaders
manage the inevitable conflicts that arise? More qualitative and
in-depth studies are required to answer these questions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a call to reconnect with behavioural roots and to better specify
the practice of exploration/exploitation and its management beyond pure
trade-off as if they were on the same continuum. Quantitative studies
have failed in specifying such phenomena:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Although the results are not completely consistent across studies, in
general they confirm that structural ambidexterity consists of
autonomous structural units for exploration and exploitation, targeted
integration to leverage assets, an overarching vision to legitimate
the need for exploration and exploitation, and leadership that is
capable of managing the tensions associated with multiple
organizational alignments</em> (O’Reilly and Tushman

<a href="#ref-OReilly2013">2013</a>, 328)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>At a high level of abstraction, it is easy to claim that firms shift
structures between exploitative and exploratory modes—but what would
this mean at ground level? Major structural transitions can be highly
disruptive. What does it mean to go from exploitation to exploration,
or the reverse? Here the research is not fine-grained enough to
provide much insight.</em>(O’Reilly and Tushman 
<a href="#ref-OReilly2013">2013</a>,
327)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We know some organizations are more ambidextrous than others, but for
this insight to be valuable we have to take a more detailed look at
the way they make their decisions, who gets involved in those
decisions, and how those decisions are implemented. For me, this is
one of the areas where ambidexterity research has the most potential.
There is, for example, some research looking at decision processes in
top management teams (Smith &amp; Tushman, 2005) and how executives
embrace paradox (Andriopoulos &amp; Lewis,2009), but I would like to see a
lot more.</em> (Birkinshaw and Gupta 
<a href="#ref-Birkinshaw2013">2013</a>, 293)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is interesting to note the interest of leadership, which had raised
as a reaction with respect to the <em>awakening of the machines</em> that
Herbert Simon dreamed of. Stanley Stark (Stark 
<a href="#ref-Stark1963">1963</a>)
in his review on creative leadership mentions the work Philippe
Selznick’s of administrations through leadership (Selznick

<a href="#ref-Selznick1957">1957</a>), here is a stimulating extract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Why did Professor Selznick write this particular essay? And why did
he title it Leadership in Administration? Any reply to the first
question should include, I believe, a statement to the following
effect: he wrote it as an intuitivist supplement, corrective, or
antithesis to the formalist essay that Herbert A. Simon titled
Administrative behaviour. And any reply to the second question should
include, I believe, a statement to the following effect: leadership in
the old-fashioned sense, which stood so high with the intuitivist
likes of Plato, Carlyle, and Weber, stands very low in the world of
scientific empiricism; in Administrative behaviour&hellip; the word
leadership itself cannot be found in the heading of a single chapter,
chapter section, chapter subsection, or anywhere in the index. &hellip; My
guess is that Professor Simon would wonder much, and that Professor
Selznick would find it exceedingly difficult to satisfy him. But we
must satisfy him if we are ever to convince him that at any given time
the computer is not doing all the thinking that middle or upper
managers do. For example, when he says that “we will have the
technical capability, by 1985, to manage corporations by machine”
(1960, p. 52), are we entitled to smugly retort, “Sure, but what about
leading, creatively leading—a la Selznick—by machine?” if we cannot
reach agreement on what Professor Selznick means? It is one thing to
say to Professor Simon— “You’ve left creative leadership out of your
social psychology and out of your machine” — and another to
demonstrate that he has omitted a piece of reality.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leadership is presented as a counterforce and extension of bounded
rationality and technologies of organizing to reach optima. The
decisions, the vision given by leadership remains to be specified.
When comparing the structural and processual models (Benner and Tushman

<a href="#ref-Benner2015">2015</a>; Birkinshaw and Gupta

<a href="#ref-Birkinshaw2013">2013</a>), the contextual approach encourages to look
at the business environment, not only at business unit level but in a
more general perspective. With innovation management, organization may
have to adapt in different ways, as it can shift the performance
frontier of exploration and exploitation. Mary Benner suggests the
innovation locus (Lakhani, Lifshitz-Assaf, and Tushman

<a href="#ref-Lakhani2013">2013</a>) having shifted and being shaped in different
ways (e.g. open innovation, community-based, exploratory partnerships),
the ambidextrous organization should be revised as the adaptive process
may no longer rely on <em>models based on cost minimization, local search,
hierarchy, power, control of contingencies, and extrinsic motivation</em>
(Benner and Tushman 
<a href="#ref-Benner2015">2015</a>, 508). It is interesting to
note that this in-between concept, sheds a fresh light on fixations and
path-dependency of some constructs that are showing limitations.</p>
<p>Similarly, in (Gupta, Smith, and Shalley 
<a href="#ref-Gupta2006">2006</a>, 699),
the system design with its engineering background on modularity
(Henderson and Clark 
<a href="#ref-Henderson1990">1990</a>) brings another way of
contextualizing ambidexterity given the system architecture and
innovation. Exploration activities can be conducted locally for a
module, and exploitation can carry on in others as long as interfaces
remain stable. The coupling between modules may also an obstacle to such
approaches as explained in (Benner and Tushman 
<a href="#ref-Benner2003">2003</a>,
247).</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>Exploration and exploitation non-mutual conditioning may be then
challenged by innovation practices and loci. The decision-making and
managerial capacity (e.g. leadership) are not fully elucidated in the
literature and would require fine-grained qualitative research.</p>
<p>Another way of considering the balancing of the dichotomy between
exploration and exploitation, is to look at how the literature on
paradoxes have nurtured a way of managing collective action (Smith and
Lewis <a href="#ref-Smith2011">2011</a>). It would allow considering the
antagonistic effects with different main performance criteria
(generation of alternatives, and efficiency of choice).</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="managing-with-paradoxes">Managing with paradoxes</h3>
<p>The organizational ambidexterity literature with its organization
adaptation for innovation and efficiency plays with translation of the
underlying adaptive process articulated with exploration/exploitation.
Researchers in the field have already stressed its limitations and calls
for future research. Their synthesis calls for forms of ambidextrous
leadership (O’Reilly and Tushman 
<a href="#ref-OReilly2007">2007</a>) or at least a
crucial involvement of senior management to oversee forms of
structural/sequential/contextual ambidexterity. For a manager it will
imply then allocating resources for a regime or the other in different
ways in space and time. From a behavioural perspective, the manager will
bear the paradoxes associated with the co-existence of these regimes or
inversely will manage other individuals with such paradoxes (Papachroni,
Heracleous, and Paroutis 
<a href="#ref-Papachroni2015">2015</a>).</p>
<p>Due to multiplicity of studies, their nature, their unit of analysis,
the triggered paradoxes would be of different types when looking at the
critical literature review of (Gupta, Smith, and Shalley

<a href="#ref-Gupta2006">2006</a>) in their special research forum. For instance,
the definition of exploration and exploitation may depend on the unit of
analysis chosen in the studies (multi-scale problem), the continuity or
orthogonality of the two constructs, the system dimension opposed to
organization and individual, interpersonal learning, tacit knowledge,
inter-dependencies and local/distant search. They also specify that
learning mechanisms associated with exploration or exploitation may of
be different nature, as it was confirmed in (Garcias, Dalmasso, and
Sardas 
<a href="#ref-Garcias2015">2015</a>). Paradoxes then bring the promise of
blending the dichotomy in a distributed way dependent on context.
For instance, (Leonard-Barton 
<a href="#ref-Leonard-Barton1992">1992</a>) reveals
the paradox of new product development managers having to rely on
existing core capabilities and still avoid associated core rigidities:
e.g. values, skills and knowledge, managerial systems and technical
systems. Paradoxes for project management were handled with different
strategies associated with adaptive limitations: abandonment,
recidivism, reorientation and isolation.</p>
<p>But paradoxes can also be embraced to manage a firm specially for senior
management (Smith and Tushman 
<a href="#ref-Smith2005">2005</a>) who can overview
the numerous organizational tensions (Smith and Lewis

<a href="#ref-Smith2011">2011</a>). Teams arrangements, communication, leadership
coaching contribute to adopting and managing the paradoxes in a <em>dynamic
equilibrium</em> in order to avoid the fatality of cyclical patterns
associated to paradoxes. For instance, (Smith and Lewis

<a href="#ref-Smith2011">2011</a>, 392) proposes that some individuals with
cognitive/behavioural complexity and emotional equanimity are likely to
accept paradoxical tensions instead of defending. It is an invitation to
dig into the constraints to better twist the paradoxes into managerial
action. The unit of analysis to cope with organizational tensions may
also be translated in different action registers as demonstrated in
(O’Dwyer, Sweeney, and Cormican 
<a href="#ref-ODwyer2017">2017</a>) with project
portfolio ambidexterity. CEOs are found to be using practices based on
paradoxes to drive performance and innovation in firms (Fredberg

<a href="#ref-Fredberg2014">2014</a>).</p>
<p>However, despite the attractiveness of paradox theory as an alternative
to contingency approaches, the work of Linda Putnam in (Cunha and Putnam

<a href="#ref-Cunha2017">2017</a>) addresses the potential paradox of a success
trap for this vigorous literature: the paradox of the paradox. Two
issues retained our attention: the imprecision of the word and the
paradox reversibility while being a problem/tool to manage. For our
concern, as we question the possibility of actually organizing
collective action through the paradoxes of ambidextrous tensions, its
practice may become very diffuse and hard to grasp. Furthermore, the
tensions created by these <em>stretch goals</em> (Sitkin et al.

<a href="#ref-Sitkin2011">2011</a>) may be favoured in some organizational contexts
but it also raises the question of the ambidextrous individual able to
cope with such <em>double binds</em> (Holmqvist and Spicer

<a href="#ref-Holmqvist2013">2013</a>). The concept of double-bind thinking,
introduced by Gregory Bateson (Bateson et al. 
<a href="#ref-Bateson1956">1956</a>,

<a href="#ref-Bateson1963">1963</a>) may encourage some kind of schizophrenia or at
least high level of stress among individuals subject to such
organizational tensions. Others may be more successful. Such unbalanced
performance for ambidextrous strategy and leadership encourages to dig a
little further into the cognitive level.</p>
<p>For instance, in (Laureiro-Martínez et al.

<a href="#ref-Laureiro-Martinez2015a">2015</a>), magnetic resonance imaging is
performed on individuals to identify brain regions supporting the
decision-making associated with exploration/exploitation and its
trade-off. The findings include the awareness of the environment of
decision-making, the influence of emotion and attention, the sequencing
and switch of the two regimes, and learning mechanisms. The authors
insist on the fact that their results do not encourage any form of
selection and hiring but rather on the training.</p>
<p>Similarly, the contributions of the MIT’s System Thinking department’s
director Peter Senge (Senge 
<a href="#ref-Senge1990">1990</a>) is suggested in the
discussion of (Leonard-Barton 
<a href="#ref-Leonard-Barton1992">1992</a>, 192). He
calls in his paper for heuristics associated with leadership styles
supporting a generative learning instead of adaptive learning. The
leader could have new roles to support the tensions and organizational
learning; leader as a designer, teacher and steward. The associated
skills and management tools should then be developed, and would allow
extending the model of adaptive learning with creation process in the
continuity of coping mechanisms with a broader system thinking. This
view of managerial action recalls also the works of (Starbuck

<a href="#ref-Starbuck1983">1983</a>) considering organizations as action
generators. So, instead of relying on the individual skills to cope with
cognitive ambidexterity and associated strain, the focus could be
shifted toward methods, practices and management technologies as well as
organizational routines.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>Finally, the paradox approach may leave us without clear means of
understanding the practice of organizational ambidexterity, as it tends
to distribute the paradox on multi-scale and phenomena fashion.</p>
<p>By following the lines suggested for future research in the
ambidexterity literature reviews referenced previously, we propose to
take a closer look at the decision-making process for exploration,
exploitation and its trade-off. It may for instance document what is
expected from leadership specially if they engage in generative
practices shifting the frontiers of exploration and exploitation. So
far, we have highlighted that macro-level analysis may be insufficient
and rather too contingent, hence our need to explicit the underlying
mechanisms.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="deciding-to-innovate-micro-foundations-of-ambidextrous-organizations">Deciding to innovate: micro-foundations of ambidextrous organizations?</h2>
<p>In this final section of the chapter, we propose to analyse the
literature on decision-making supporting exploration and exploitation.
First of all, the necessity of managing the adaptive process through
exploration and exploitation was presented as a necessity to cope with
externalities and sustainability. Along with the firm’s performance,
innovation management has become the central focus of ambidexterity as
it contributes to exploration/exploitation impact and trade-off.</p>
<p>The firm’s management decides then to innovate to feed the adaptive
process with exploration regime which then requires to be transferred to
exploitation purposes. We have stressed that these two regimes can
structurally co-exist, be sequenced dynamically and more importantly may
be shaped in different ways depending on the unit of analysis
(organization, system and individual/cognitive).
Relying on the decision-making process in a <em>neo-Carnegie way</em> (Gavetti,
Levinthal, and Ocasio 
<a href="#ref-Gavetti2007">2007</a>), i.e. looping back with
the behavioural roots of (James G March 
<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>),
encourages to specify decision-making with respect to exploration,
exploitation and its balance. Decisions are considered as legitimate
unit of analysis. It is tracker of sociology of organizations (Crozier
and Friedberg 
<a href="#ref-Crozier1977">1977</a>; Pettigrew

<a href="#ref-Pettigrew1973">1973</a>; J. March 
<a href="#ref-March1991a">1991</a>), perhaps
even an artificial construct (Laroche 
<a href="#ref-Laroche1995">1995</a>) for
which we should perhaps prefer organizational action.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    Without opposing decision and course of action, we will have to look at
the impact of risk, uncertainty and the unknown as we tasked ourselves
to regard adaptive process with respect to innovation management. The
following paragraphs will aim at clarifying the nature of
decision-making in our chosen field of study and how it handles the
dichotomy and balance of both exploration and exploitation.
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="uncertainty-and-the-unknown">Uncertainty and the unknown</h3>
<p>In the assumptions made by (James G March 
<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>), the
problem space given to the firm to adapt to survive was set beforehand:
exploration was a means to search for alternatives not considered by
exploitation in the given problem space. However, the previous
paragraphs on organizational ambidexterity and the focus on exploration
preceding exploitation, gave several hints that the search could be more
complex than the one originally defined by James March. Several keywords
challenge what makes adaptiveness such as: unusual experiences, new
locus of innovation with open innovation, environment awareness, system
thinking, differences in learning mechanisms for exploration and
exploitation and the adjective generative.</p>
<p>Originally, the problem space involved statistical and optimization
dimensions for the decision-maker. In other words, statistical learning
and subjective beliefs that could be modelled in terms of probabilities.
We are in the realm of risk-taking and uncertainty. The consequences of
decisions are known but the probability of happening is not known. The
search-model of exploration consists in looking at other consequences
and decisions to enlighten the decision-maker by having the global
picture of the problem instead of being bounded. By referring again to
earlier definitions (Levinthal and March 
<a href="#ref-Levinthal1993">1993</a>,
105), the research developments suggest that exploration encourages to
specify the regime of generation or generativity of new knowledge in its
broadest sense: <em>[exploration] the pursuit of new knowledge, of things
that might come to be known</em> and <em>[exploitation] the use and
development of things already known</em>.</p>
<p>If new knowledge is generated by experiences (changing environment) or
deliberate experimentation and action, the rational choice theory
reference<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> is no longer fully valid as we force the set of
possibilities to become larger and potentially reconfigured (Hey

<a href="#ref-Hey1983">1983</a>). We enter the realm of the unknown or unknowledge
as suggested by G.L.S Shackle (Shackle 
<a href="#ref-Shackle1949">1949</a>; Frowen

<a href="#ref-Frowen1990">1990</a>).</p>
<p>In the field of operations research, (Ozdemir and Saaty

<a href="#ref-Ozdemir2006">2006</a>) proposes to add a variable labelled &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo;
with uncertain probability; the model can then be used for
decision-making and take into account the perception of the unknown. In
other words, the &ldquo;other&rdquo; states of the universe of probabilities are
integrated, so it means really re-examine the full extent of the
theoretical, objective and unbounded problem by opposition to the
rationally bounded one.</p>
<p>It is not an actual theorization of the Unknown as we have defined it:
states of nature and decisions that we are fully unaware of it but that
only action can reveal. The dynamic dimension of decision-making
naturally updates the sets of choices, consequences, and utility
function but decision theories rarely focus on this feature because of
potential problems of dynamic consistency, modelling complexity and
preference revelation given choices made (Machina

<a href="#ref-Machina1989">1989</a>; Chabris, Laibson, and Schuldt

<a href="#ref-Chabris2006">2006</a>).</p>
<p>The timing issue dragging behaviours such as patience and impulsivity
are not really our concern despite being also part of life in
organizations. We are rather interested in what could be willingly
generated in a static frame: changing belief, new decision.</p>
<p>Coming from a decision problem to another invites us to consider the
generative function that allows the transfer between the two. It is an
expansive projection by opposition to traditional projection reducing
the scope (se
Fig.<a href="#fig:projectionexpansion" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:projectionexpansion">5</a>
below). In other words, it is not reducing uncertainty over time with
numerous means of actions (Sommer, Loch, and Pich

<a href="#ref-Sommer2008">2008</a>). Instead, shifting from a problem to another
increases uncertainty temporarily before further experimentations can be
performed (e.g. testing). Likewise, the need-solution pairs developed in
(Hippel and Krogh 
<a href="#ref-VonHippel2016">2016</a>), stresses the existence
and discovery of new problems and opens a field for how to behave in
such unknown landscape.</p>

<p>Such behaviour has been studied in cognitive psychology where the
avoidance and search for the unknown can be channelled through the
curiosity and regret (Dijk and Zeelenberg 
<a href="#ref-VanDijk2007">2007</a>).
Based on information-gap theory (Ben-Haim 
<a href="#ref-Ben-Haim2006a">2006</a>),
it proposes a first step to consider known unknowns (Rumsfeld

<a href="#ref-Rumsfeld2002">2002</a>
<a href="#ref-Rumsfeld2002">a</a>,

<a href="#ref-Rumsfeld2002a">2002</a>
<a href="#ref-Rumsfeld2002a">b</a>), but double unknowns
again are not part of the equation. The case of Black Swans (Taleb

<a href="#ref-Taleb2007">2007</a>) and the types of uncertainties associated with
knowledge categories can bring a new light on the decision-making
process (Faulkner, Feduzi, and Runde 
<a href="#ref-Faulkner2017">2017</a>). It
helps defining with more clarity the boundary conditions of
expected-utility theories which presuppose what is known and uncertain,
compared to other theories such as non-expected utility ones (Machina

<a href="#ref-Machina2010">2010</a>, 
<a href="#ref-Machina1989">1989</a>; Starmer

<a href="#ref-Starmer2000">2000</a>; Quiggin 
<a href="#ref-Quiggin2014">2014</a>). But, they
still lack in sensing and seizing double unknowns despite revealing a
number of interesting behavioural features that could contribute to the
generation of new knowledge and choices. They refer to phenomena such
as: preferences reversal, dynamic inconsistency, anticipation,
optimism/pessimism, regret, that call for mathematical models that are
not additive in the classical sense.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>The literature on decision-making with respect to exploration and
exploitation, stresses the importance of generative learning and the
frontier with the unknown.</p>
<p>Decisions and search of new alternatives can be of different nature,
hence changing the nature of exploration and consequently of future
exploitation. We must study in more detail the edges of the Pareto front
and its potential crossing.</p>
<p>We propose then to study the interplay between search relieving bounded
rationality (known) and generation of new knowledge reconfiguring
problem formulation and solving (unknown).</p>

<h3 id="generative-processes-creativity-engineering-and-design">Generative processes: creativity, engineering and design</h3>
<p>Exploration distinguishes itself from exploitation by introducing a way
of reasoning that is quite challenging for it. We propose to take a
closer look at the generative phenomenon and how it is translated in
practice to support exploration.</p>
<p>The idea of generating alternatives with a background of theory of
creativity was introduced by the works of Robert Epstein. He proposed a
<em>weaker</em> definition of creativity, namely generativity, to study how
animals would engage in creative problem solving (Epstein et al.

<a href="#ref-Epstein1984">1984</a>). With his colleagues, he put forward that
pigeons would engage in actions helping them to gain insight to solve
the problem in a novel way. In that sense, we are close to the
novelty-search algorithm mentioned previously (Nguyen, Yosinski, and
Clune 
<a href="#ref-Nguyen2015">2015</a>; Cully et al. 
<a href="#ref-Cully2015">2015</a>).
Generativity is the distinctive feature of design theory and practices.
Designers engage in jotting, sketching, drawing, writing and speaking
(Brun, Le Masson, and Weil 
<a href="#ref-Brun2016">2016</a>; Goldschmidt

<a href="#ref-Goldschmidt1991">1991</a>; Ferguson 
<a href="#ref-Ferguson1992">1992</a>; Goel

<a href="#ref-Goel1995">1995</a>). All of the tasks, that could also be seen as
micro-decisions, contribute to idea generation.</p>
<p>With the emergence of brainstorming (Osborn and Rona

<a href="#ref-Osborn1959">1959</a>) coming from advertisement and the large
contributions of cognitive and group psychology (Guilford

<a href="#ref-Guilford1967">1967</a>; Amabile et al. 
<a href="#ref-Amabile1996a">1996</a>)
numerous managerial practices have been prescribed to support innovation
in organizations (Amabile 
<a href="#ref-Amabile1988">1988</a>). Our aim is not to
make an exhaustive survey of available practices, but rather to identify
the performance discriminants of generative processes supporting
exploration and eventually efficiency exploitation. It will help us in
better understanding what causes and follows a generative process,
i.e. the &ldquo;operator&rdquo; that supports the discovery of new knowledge, that
allows making our way through the unknown.</p>
<h4 id="design-thinking">Design Thinking</h4>
<p>In the last two-three decades, Design Thinking has become the centre of
attention for numerous companies and consultancy firms (IDEO,
Continuum). Looking back at its origins at Stanford’s School of
Engineering, the director of Product Design (Faste

<a href="#ref-Faste1994">1994</a>) stresses the need to teach young engineers to
ambidextrous thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The gestation of Ambidextrous Thinking has occurred both in a College
of Visual and Performing Arts (Syracuse University) and a School of
Engineering (Stanford University). Thinking in the former setting is
often characterized as being soft and fuzzy, in the latter, cold and
hard. These characterizations are impediments to understanding the
nature of design process. The central mission of Ambidextrous Thinking
is simply to acquaint engineering students with the full range of
their human potential in order to encourage a more balanced and potent
approach to problem solving. In so doing it demonstrates the important
connections between these seeming opposites.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several techniques are taught to students to deal with reasoning
trespassing traditional analytical thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Many of the techniques pioneered in this class are showing up in
local research and design firms. Examples include mind-mapping,
scenario improvisation and story-boarding. I believe there is more to
this than the efficacy of the techniques students are bringing with
them to the work place. With the introduction of electronics,
increasing numbers of products are as much about the design of desired
behaviours as they are with the delivery of utilitarian function. Sole
reliance on analytical skills will not guarantee engineering success
in the increasingly consumer oriented marketplace, nor will it help
engineers process the overwhelming amount of information that they
will be facing in their careers</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Design Thinking has evolved in a methodological toolbox to democratize
design to all individuals in a wide variety of contexts (firm, public
institutions, associations and classrooms). It tends to challenge design
as a profession (Kimbell 
<a href="#ref-Kimbell2011">2011</a>,

<a href="#ref-Kimbell2012">2012</a>). However, its underlying generative processes
can be coded to explain engineering in its globality (Mabogunje,
Sonalkar, and Leifer 
<a href="#ref-Mabogunje2016">2016</a>). It is powerful and can
be hosted in firms to stimulate new product development at its frond
end, but still raises the question of its performance (Schmiedgen et al.

<a href="#ref-Schmiedgen2016">2016</a>). The task is rather complex as performance
criteria considered for tame problems (in exploitation) are ill-suited
for the wicked problems at stake (Rittel and Webber

<a href="#ref-Rittel1973">1973</a>; Buchanan 
<a href="#ref-Buchanan1992">1992</a>).</p>
<p>Focusing on the generative phenomenon <em>per se</em>, or in its simplest form
&ldquo;idea generation&rdquo; (fluency), we should pay attention closely enough to
what supports generativity in the design (thinking) process. For
instance, (Sonalkar, Mabogunje, and Leifer 
<a href="#ref-Sonalkar2013">2013</a>)
introduced the <em>Interaction Dynamics Notation</em> to track &ldquo;concept
generation&rdquo; and a comparison is made against Linkography (Goldschmidt

<a href="#ref-Goldschmidt2014">2014</a>). Their research method stresses how
crucial the expression of an idea is for the individual and
inter-personal relations engaged in the design process. Works in
cognitive psychology from (Smith, Ward, and Schumacher

<a href="#ref-Smith1993">1993</a>; Ward 
<a href="#ref-Ward2007">2007</a>,

<a href="#ref-Ward1994">1994</a>) have also stressed the decisiveness of knowledge
categories to stimulate idea generation with the notion of <em>fixation
effects</em> It creates a potential performance reference point for
exploration. Such anchoring could be associated with boundedness, and
requiring a search for other alternative, but also the limitations of
search in a given problem space.</p>
<h4 id="design-theories-and-design-engineering-rules-and-fixations">Design theories and design engineering: rules and fixations</h4>
<p>Other approaches originating also from an engineering background have
developed theories to frame the design reasoning in different
universities across the globe under the umbrella of the Design Society.
Currently, C-K theory (Hatchuel and Weil 
<a href="#ref-Hatchuel2009">2009</a>) has
managed to be general enough to explain other design theories and
practices (Le Masson, Dorst, and Subrahamanian

<a href="#ref-LeMasson2013a">2013</a>; Agogué and Kazakçı 
<a href="#ref-Agogue2014b">2014</a>;
Hatchuel, Le Masson, and Weil 
<a href="#ref-Hatchuel2011">2011</a>). Considering
design theories, with respect to creativity and innovation management
(Le Masson, Weil, and Hatchuel 
<a href="#ref-LeMasson2017">2017</a>) also allows
extending design theories domains where engineering and product design
have been lacking (Eppinger 
<a href="#ref-Eppinger2011">2011</a>). So using design
theories as a reference tool to measure generativity could be an
appropriate instrument. Tracking design fixations relating to cognitive
fixation effects was studied and modelled with C-K theory (Agogué, Le
Masson, and Robinson 
<a href="#ref-Agogue2012a">2012</a>; Le Masson, Hatchuel, and
Weil 
<a href="#ref-LeMasson2011">2011</a>; Houdé 
<a href="#ref-Houde1997">1997</a>).</p>
<p>The capacity to avoid fixations, potential traps associated with
exploitation, associated routines, and heuristics appears as a crucial
performance criteria of the generative processes supporting exploration.
The power to defixate will be hold as key to value the richness,
usefulness of exploration.</p>
<p>However, this performance may be seen as self-destructive or
antithetical for exploitation. They may generate concepts and knowledge
pushing decision-making to its limits and complicating learning
mechanisms. Indeed, these generative processes may be seen as upstream
processes, in the fuzzy front end (Brown and Katz

<a href="#ref-Brown2011">2011</a>; Leifer and Steinert 
<a href="#ref-Leifer2011">2011</a>) for
design thinking, as it is the case also for innovative design practices
by opposition to systematic design (Pahl and Beitz

<a href="#ref-Pahl2007">2007</a>) or rule-based design (Le Masson, Hatchuel, and
Weil 
<a href="#ref-LeMasson2011">2011</a>).</p>
<p>Returning to home base by avoiding spin-off and fully ad-hoc devices
mentioned in organizational ambidexterity encourages to think of how
beliefs and utility (value) are managed to reach the end decision to
innovate. The organizational learning calls for a third loop of learning
(Leifer and Steinert 
<a href="#ref-Leifer2011">2011</a>), or a meta-learning (Lei,
Hitt, and Bettis 
<a href="#ref-Lei1996">1996</a>) extending the single/double-loop
learning (Levitt and March 
<a href="#ref-Levitt1988">1988</a>; Argyris and Schön

<a href="#ref-Argyris1978">1978</a>). Both favour reconfiguring the system in a
wider perspective. It would not be incrementally, nor just between
elements, but rather with underlying categories and descriptors.</p>
<p>In a tangent approach and still without considering the screening issue,
researchers in design management have largely insisted on the vitality
of the creation of meaning to support innovation management through
design practice (Verganti and Dell’Era 
<a href="#ref-Verganti2014">2014</a>). In
that perspective, we rally the notion of dynamic punctuated equilibrium
(Brown and Eisenhardt 
<a href="#ref-Brown1997">1997</a>), where the exploitation is
relieved from strictness to explore with a semi-structure through
different means of experimenting. The necessity of a temporal or
structural handover is blended in the process. This &ldquo;objective&rdquo; of
meaning and stabilization is also clearly described in the works of
Carliss Baldwin with the design rules (Baldwin and Clark

<a href="#ref-Baldwin2000">2000</a>). Rules can then be used as criteria for
decisions, and organize design activities around these.</p>
<h4 id="homo-faberdeux-ex-machina-designing-mutations"><em>Homo Faber</em>/<em>Deux ex machina</em>: Designing mutations</h4>
<p>In a perhaps slightly outdated practice (Kesselring, Fritz (VDI

<a href="#ref-KesselringFritzVDI1942">1942</a>) stemming from an earlier version of
systematic design (Pahl and Beitz 
<a href="#ref-Pahl2007">2007</a>), German
engineers looked at decision-making for product design where the design
process is punctuated by technical and economical evaluation enhanced by
research and idea generation and ad-hoc decisions. He proposes that it
is a means of developing products and also coming up with technical
mutations. The biological analogy is derived from evolutionary theories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Finally, the following interesting analogy between the divine act of
creation in nature and the human act of creation in the technology
should be noted. In both cases, from time to time, there is a
discontinuity, apparently without a demonstrable relation to what has
gone before, something new. We call this a &ldquo;biological mutation&rdquo; and
mean by it the realization of a divine idea, the other: &ldquo;technical
mutation&rdquo;, meaning the sudden appearance and the first realization of
a human idea. Just as it is one of the great tasks of biology to
investigate the emergence of mutations in their field, so for us it
must be one of the top guidelines to explore the preconditions for the
emergence of ideas.</em><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his paper written during his time at Siemens, he does not develop the
importance of models design to value ideas’ technical/economical
dimensions contributing to the decision process. The idea remains
seductive, as he departs from a classical evolutionary perspective by
the fact he intends to generate mutations. The origin of the mutation,
and its actual process remains to be specified.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>So far, we have insisted on the necessity to have generative processes
supporting exploration in the sense they should generate alternatives.
Fluency is key.</p>
<p>Second, the ability to defixate is important to value alternatives
differing from those at reach in exploitation regime. Methods and models
are required to support such process that is not as straightforward due
to biases and heuristics.</p>
<p>Third, a corollary, to counter isolation of exploration (James G March
<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>), generative processes should look at avoiding
concepts being a wildcard in the game of exploration/exploitation
trade-off. Specially for decision-making and the meaning creation as the
beliefs and utilities may be twisted depending on the course of action
and life of the concept in the firm.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we see that exploration can be of two different orders and
interacting with exploitation in the realm of what is known but also
with the unknown. Such interplay brings new complexities for
decision-making due to problem-formulation. It raises also new questions
for organizational learning and adaptation.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="organizing-ambidexterity-through-interactions">Organizing ambidexterity through interactions</h3>
<p>Managing generative processes, managing design and its impact on
exploitation routines (problem-solving, decision-making) requires
overcoming the core performances of fluency and defixation. In (James G
March 
<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>; Dong, March, and Workiewicz

<a href="#ref-Dong2017">2017</a>), he advocated that the volume of ideas,
technologies, ventures is a necessity in the spirit of technologies of
foolishness without explaining the tension and selection between
explored and exploited alternatives. So far, we have developed through
the literature the necessity to manage the trade-off of
exploration/exploitation, and each regime individually, with an emphasis
that the trick lies in exploration and its transition. Generative
processes would be the engine of exploration and simultaneously
complexify its articulation with exploitation. We have specified that
deciding to innovate implies revisiting the decision-making process. How
could this distance be reduced? The question becomes then how to manage
generativity and how to manage design.</p>
<h4 id="managing-design">Managing design</h4>
<p>The role of the leader as a designer had already been introduced (Senge

<a href="#ref-Senge1990">1990</a>), and recent works have also stressed that
managers should not be only focused on decision-making but perhaps
should be designers (Boland and Collopy 
<a href="#ref-Boland2004">2004</a>). If the
firm is fully design-oriented do we avoid decisions? Either way,
collective action will be organized in some way and will contribute to
the purpose of the firm.</p>
<p>The locus of Design in the firm and interactions with other departments
is rather critical to understand its impact. When surveying the role of
industrial design in British firms (Gorb and Dumas

<a href="#ref-Gorb1987">1987</a>), Angela Dumas in her years at the London Business
School’s Centre for Design Management, revisiting the notion of design
given by Simon’s definition where Design departs from Science: <em>Everyone
who designs devises a course of action aimed at changing existing
situations into preferred ones</em> (Simon 
<a href="#ref-Simon1996">1996</a>). Instead
of only focusing the artificial dimension of design, i.e. development of
an artefact, A.Dumas and P.Gorb insist on the system of artefacts and
how individuals interact with such system. Design’s definition is
extended to take into account the managerial and behavioural dimensions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>a course of action for the development of an artefact or a system of
artefacts; including the series of organizational activities required
to achieve that development</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They show that design occurs in a silent form already across the firm
despite not being recognized as such: professional designers, design
department etc. If design exists in a diffuse way across, so it means
that we could have a way to articulate the generative processes’ outputs
with existing routines as individuals engage in design in their own way
and domain. For Design Thinking practice, several tools used that fall
in the categories of need-finding, idea generation and idea testing
(Seidel and Fixson 
<a href="#ref-Seidel2013">2013</a>) will bring limitations and
support other practices. Anyhow, several ad-hoc management tools and
practices have to be implemented to link this exploration practice with
product development for instance (Beyhl, Berg, and Giese

<a href="#ref-Beyhl2014">2014</a>; Beyhl and Giese 
<a href="#ref-Beyhl2015">2015</a>).</p>
<p>The role of prototyping appears crucial to implement Design Thinking
(Holloway 
<a href="#ref-Holloway2009">2009</a>; Stigliani and Ravasi

<a href="#ref-Stigliani2012">2012</a>). Klaus Krippendorff largely contributed to
the importance of artefacts and the associated semantic turn
(Krippendorff 
<a href="#ref-Krippendorff1989">1989</a>). In a similar way, Angela
Dumas (Dumas 
<a href="#ref-Dumas1994">1994</a>) stressed the importance of relying
and building <em>totems</em> through metaphor-making in product development as
it can engage the ‘silent designers’ (Dumas and Mintzberg

<a href="#ref-Dumas1989">1989</a>, 
<a href="#ref-Dumas1991">1991</a>) to revisit the
decision-making process altogether around these totems. Based on a case
on shoe design, here is a totem example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The result is a set of slides, caricatures, and words that represents
the product family - this is the totem. Most of the shoe
manufacturer’s teams produced totems consisting of a phrase and a
slide, or a slide and a caricature. While totems can include several
slides, caricatures, and phrases, it is important that they combine to
form a simple and memorable metaphor, and this is often best achieved
with just one or two phrases and images.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Referring to totems call for a (too) short digression on the works of
Emile Durkheim (Durkheim 
<a href="#ref-Durkheim1915">1915</a>). He reveals how
religion is social phenomenon, pushing aside the traditional sacred
dimension on the back seat, and insisting rather on the collective
consciousness built around totems. If we allowed us such detour, it is
because of the works of André Orléan on the notion of &ldquo;value&rdquo; in
economics (Orléan 
<a href="#ref-Orlean">2011</a>). He proposes that the value
should not be considered as a substance in itself driven by work value
and subjective utility in economics models, but rather stemming from the
market economy where producers and buyers (exchangers) meet to trade
goods. So it is the circulation that makes value and meaning.</p>
<h4 id="managing-meaning-and-making-sense-of-the-unknown">Managing meaning and making sense of the unknown</h4>
<p>These notions of meaning and value around the unknown shaped by
generative processes encourage to manage generativity through its social
dimension that crystallizes around the decision-making, the learning,
the sharing and the diffusion.</p>
<p>One could then engage design in the firm through the cultural impact
(Buchanan 
<a href="#ref-Buchanan2015">2015</a>) by supposing that design is more
mindset enhancing daily concerns. The trick is also to reach out for all
<em>silent designers</em> if we follow the spirit of democratizing design and
creativity. Design Thinking has proposed that the empathy building for
users could support a design thinking culture within the firm (Elsbach
and Stigliani 
<a href="#ref-Elsbach2018">2018</a>). Based on the literature on
organizational routines, the trick is also to be able to frame Design
Thinking within the firm. It appears crucial (Carlgren, Rauth, and
Elmquist 
<a href="#ref-Carlgren2016a">2016</a>) as it can become in many different
forms and relying on different set of tools. Several themes can be
identified: User focus, Problem framing, Visualization, Experimentation
and Diversity. They all involve principles, practices and mindsets. The
latter will contribute to its culture which can be even more enforced
through management education and wide training programs (Dunne and
Martin 
<a href="#ref-Dunne2006">2006</a>; Martin 
<a href="#ref-Martin2009">2009</a>). Yet,
reaching institutionalization may not be the only key to let innovative
design develop and be sustainable in the firm due to key players: silent
designers (Dumas and Mintzberg 
<a href="#ref-Dumas1989">1989</a>). They are those
who engage in some generative processes on a daily basis with, for, or
against rational-based technologies (management technologies, routines,
communication channels, meetings, gates etc.).</p>
<p>Furthermore, making decisions and their formalization may be not key in
early phases of generativity because of the lack of shared understanding
and belief. The middle-ground between generated concepts and social
system is the place where they simultaneously shape each other (Akrich
et al. 
<a href="#ref-Akrich2002">2002</a>). Individual will gradually gain interest
(<em>intéressement</em>) that can eventually sustain innovation management,
without focusing on the rationality of decisions [(Mintzberg and
Westley 
<a href="#ref-Mintzberg2001">2001</a>)]<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. This analytical lens leads to
how sensemaking (Weick, Sutcliffe, and Obstfeld 
<a href="#ref-Weick2005">2005</a>)
can contribute to managing the unknown.</p>
<p>In the case of product innovation, some works have stressed the
sensemaking for product innovation showing that its system have
different dynamic compared with non-innovative contexts (Dougherty et
al. 
<a href="#ref-Dougherty2000">2000</a>). For instance, they stress that tensions
are created in through different themes: framing of knowledge (new)
links, tensions across product/business/strategy ventilating sense and
knowledge across all levels of the firm. Making decisions on innovation
would be a fallacy where people actually look for approval and rather
building sense interactively (Christiansen and Varnes

<a href="#ref-Christiansen2007">2007</a>). This viewpoint insists that innovation
management should create the means to support such interactionist action
to sustain learning mechanisms and handling novelty from exploration to
exploitation. In other words, the creation of meaning, the sense-making
and associated learning triggered by generative practices rely on a
certain <strong>ecology of generativity</strong>. We derive the notion from the
ecology of creativity described in (Cohendet, Grandadam, and Simon

<a href="#ref-Cohendet2009">2009</a>; Harrington 
<a href="#ref-Harrington1990">1990</a>) but
also the case of managing technical experts in science-based firms
revisiting the concept of epistemic communities by creating diversity
(proto-epistemic societies) in (Cabanes 
<a href="#ref-Cabanes2017">2017</a>).</p>
<p>In (Stigliani and Ravasi 
<a href="#ref-Stigliani2012">2012</a>), they refer to
<em>prospective models of sensemaking</em> driven by design thinking practice
(Continuum agency) but unfortunately it considers only the design
process without calling for the generativity for the client or the
designed object for end-users. We can actually question the usefulness
as the CEO of Continuum stated in (Lockwood 
<a href="#ref-Lockwood2010">2010</a>,
20):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q:I would think that afterward they might fall back to their more
analytical thought processes. A: Oh, that’s absolutely true. But it’s
progress, even if it’s like taking two steps forward and one step
back. In some cases, they may even have a natural tendency toward
design thinking, but it has been sup- pressed because of the way
things are traditionally done in corporations. Q:I wonder if there is
any concrete way to evaluate the prevalence of design thinking or
design as a competitive strategy in to- day’s organizations. Do you
have any recommendations for how we might assess this? A:That’s a
great question. I don’t know how you would measure it, though. You
know, that’s kind of the essence of the value of design thinking: You
start to value things you just can’t measure. If you try to measure
what you can’t measure&hellip;</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, generative processes rely on several practices, heuristics
and learning mechanisms that include a social dimension to create
meaning, make sense, that could perhaps in the end lead to decisions
once interest and beliefs are settled. A sister approach is also
addressed with the sensemaking perspective in a crisis mode (Berthod and
Müller-seitz 
<a href="#ref-Berthod2016a">2016</a>) with the notion of managing the
unexpected (Weick 
<a href="#ref-Weick2011">2011</a>) and highly-resilient
organizations (Sutcliffe and Christianson 
<a href="#ref-Sutcliffe2012">2012</a>).
But it is unfortunately a case for high uncertainty and extreme level of
adaptiveness.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>Finally, we have seen that there are ways of explaining how the unknown
could be used as a driver to create meaning and gradually make sense of
the novelty. Totem, metaphors, desirable futures can used to organize
innovation. But still, by being &ldquo;pre-decision&rdquo; it avoids the
decision-making and some behavioural dimensions of exploitation.
Inversely, if were to follow this interactionist perspective we struggle
to identify the handles to manage exploration.</p>
<p>What are the useful, necessary articulations and interdependencies to
work on? Should we only rely on generating <em>enough</em> and hope that some
will go through this ecology of generativity?</p>
<p>This probe onto decision-making for innovation, playing on the balance
and performance of exploration and exploitation tends to reinforce the
dichotomy between the two. It shows from the organizational adaptation
and learning perspective that generative processes can occur <em>upstream</em>
or in a distributed way. In any case, they emphasize the antagonistic
effects of exploration and exploitation. The modes of collective action
can take different shapes (linear and/or interactive), but still rely on
managerial personae to separate and balance both regimes.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-conclusion-limiting-assumptions-on-the-extension-of-generative-processes">Chapter conclusion: limiting assumptions on the extension of generative processes</h2>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>In this first chapter of literature review, we started with the seminal
adaptive model (James G March <a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>) that was largely
extended in the literature of organizational ambidexterity. As the model
is now reaching out for innovation management with the tensions of
exploration and exploitation, we proposed to discuss this initial
setting with management of the unknown. Several writings indicate that
the constructs of exploration, exploitation and ambidexterity require
clearer definition and understanding to prescribe practices due to the
nuances brought by impact of the chosen unit of analysis (individual,
social, organizational and system) as well as contingent factors. This
ambiguous stretch is due to the gap created by models, derived from
problem-solving, currently applied to new contexts and knowledge drive
by innovation and the unknown. Is it still conceivable to separate
exploration from exploitation in the unknown?</p>
<p>Given the behavioural roots of this work, we got to the point of
discussing the literature on decision-making with respect to the unknown
that is addressed by the evolution, emphasis and drift of the construct
of exploration. Reaching out for innovation reconsiders the search-based
model of adaptive processes, so that exploration is no longer just a
regime ensuring that the system is adapted enough to the unbounded
problem at stake. Indeed, novel alternatives and consequences are
generated dynamically expanding the problem domain with unknown
probabilities.</p>
<p>We then focused our attention on the generative phenomenon that supports
this problem shift, expansion and potential reconfiguration. Theories,
tools, methods and practices exist to support such phenomenon. Most of
them could be labelled under the Design umbrella, but also many other
are more <em>silent</em>. Generative processes take place in an ubiquitous
fashion when compared to rational models supporting exploitation. The
emergent nature of novelty, preceding problem formulation and solving,
and making decisions, pushed our reasoning down the lines of
interactionist and network perspectives supporting the creation of
meaning and collective sense-making. These approaches are definitely
complementary and fill the gaps left by a pure decision-making in firms.</p>
<p>Relying on a rather linear perspective of innovation through
<strong>adaption</strong> could be a first approach to organize generative processes
for exploration and balancing out exploitation for learning and
adaptation. The organization learns and adapts from generated mutations
in the Known or Unknown[^8]. The edge between what is known and unknown
challenges the nature of the non-mutual conditioning between exploration
and exploitation.</p>
<p>It encourages the training of leaders to develop their ambidextrous
thinking and manage their teams accordingly. The second approach sees
innovation in a more networking perspective through <strong>interactions</strong>. It
would promote the design of spaces, networks and interactions means by
management executives. This in-between perspective gives more room to
the generative phenomenon so that they could then support an ecology of
generativity.</p>
<p>One could argue for non-interventionist management, but we made the
assumption that we would steer the <em>performance of the generative
process</em>: fluency and defixation, and the organizational impact and
sustain. The first criteria is more related to the standalone practice
reduced to the individual or the design team, whereas the second calls
for the diffusion, learning and regeneration of the organization subject
to the generative phenomenon.</p>
<p>At last, we have taken a micro and then a macro perspective to
sustaining organizational learning and adaptation through ambidexterity
and innovation. We have elucidated the thought process of the individual
(decision and design) and its organization in a broader sense. The
interactionist view describes also the social dimension. If we use again
the biological metaphor, one the axioms of ecology is that the success
of a unit is measured by the number of descendants. Transposed to our
generativity, we can question what the unit means for generative
phenomena as they can localized and linearized (design department,
exploration-dedicated unit), or be distributed (we are all designers!).
We could then envision a generated concept (a prototype, a product, a
technology, a function etc.) or consider a colony of generated concepts
that have something in common and for which individual sacrifice is the
norm (portfolio, program, product line etc.).</p>
<p>We believe then that in a firm context, there are also other action
means to sustain generativity and an efficient interaction with
exploration and exploitation. We propose then to look at other ways of
managing the unknown mainly through project management. By doing so, we
can overcome the several limitations addressed in this chapter for
models of ambidexterity through adaptation, interactions and their
management. Projects, by encapsulating management activities, are indeed
a device that sometimes can be the equivalent to small firm, or business
unit, or sometimes just a piece in a larger puzzle.</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning that in the cumulative prospect theory, the
original formulation violated the fundamental transitivity. They
managed accommodating the axiom by changing the integral measure
with weights and still allowing reversal as in Allais’ paradox and

<p>Author’s translation: &ldquo;Schließlich sei noch auf folgende
interessante Analogie zwischen dem göttlichen Schöpfungsakt in der
Natur und dem menschlichen Schöpfungsakt in der Technick
hingewiesen. Im einen wie im anderen Falle entsteht von Zeit zu Zeit
unstetig, anscheinend ohne nachweisbare Beziehung zu
Vorangegangenen, etwas Neues. Wir nenen das eine: &ldquo;biologische
Mutation&rdquo; und verstehen darunter die Verwicklichung einer göttlichen
Idee, das andere: &ldquo;technische Mutation&rdquo; und meinen damit das
plötzliche Auftreten und die erste Verwicklichung einer menschlichen
Idee. Ebenso wie es eine der grossen Aufgaben der Biologie ist, das
Zustandekommen von Mutationen für ihren Bereich zu erforschen, so
muss es auch für uns zu den obersten Richtlinien zählen, die
Vorbedingungen für das Auftreten enuer Ideen zu ergründen.&rdquo; <a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
