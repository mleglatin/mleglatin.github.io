          <h1>Chapter 7 - Management anomaly specification</h1>

          <div class="article-style">
            <p>In this chapter, we propose to synthesize the anomalies highlighted by
the cases’ results of the previous chapter before listing the
requirements to design a new model extending the literature models of
non-mutual conditioning between exploration and exploitation, in order
to understand the observed phenomena.</p>
<p>The first feature raised through the descriptors and the comparison
between models’ prediction is perhaps the continuity and orthogonality
of exploration/exploitation that is dealt at different levels:
generative processes, coordination mechanisms, environment cognition and
organization design. So, we confirm the nuances expressed in (Gupta,
Smith, and Shalley 
<a href="#ref-Gupta2006">2006</a>). What is perhaps more
surprising and natural at the same time is the fact that exploration can
be based on exploitation characteristics. However, the cases show these
can be beneficial or counter-productive for innovation management, thus
requiring an careful management to counter the forces of traditional
models of ambidexterity.</p>
<p>The second aspect is that we can assert that ambidexterity kills
innovation. It is of course a bold statement, but the meta-language of
exploration/exploitation tends to ignore the micro-foundations of
collective action such as decision-making and generative processes
(Birkinshaw and Gupta 
<a href="#ref-Birkinshaw2013">2013</a>). The actual
implementation of ambidexterity, be it contextual, structural or
sequential, induces numerous complications dealing with
exploration/exploitation regime separation for practice. More
specifically, it appears to be incompatible with practices where the
unknown is effectively managed.</p>
<p>The cases show they follow organizational ambidexterity, but at the same
time, have mitigated efficiency when it comes to exploration or
exploitation standalone. Radical innovation is not really achieved for
the originally intended exploration project, despite having several
other valuable takeaways (Elmquist and Le Masson

<a href="#ref-Elmquist2009">2009</a>). There is tendency to leave exploitation
routines as a static reference point, as a fixation effect, and let
exploration free float in other directions without carefully managing
the search and generation directions.</p>
<p>Organization design being constricted by certification and market
constraints, generative processes and organization ambidexterity clashes
to support this enclosed change calling for a support of organizational
metabolism and potential <em>regenerative dynamic capabilities</em> (Ambrosini,
Bowman, and Collier 
<a href="#ref-Ambrosini2009">2009</a>). Despite appropriate
interactionism, we have seen that practices are not sufficient to
sustain generative processes into a full settlement organizations. At
best, in the case of the icing conditions detection, the settlement is
partial as the alignment with BU management and Engineering department
remains controversial. Consequently, reconsidering organization design
supported/supporting generative processes appears crucial, as it
probably implies considering the mirroring of the engineering efforts.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>Consequently, we would propose some requirements extending the
literature models presented previously. These where limited to
non-mutual conditioning of exploration and exploitation. This extension
is crucial since the observed phenomena tends to show dynamics sustained
at the level of engineering design practices challenging the
coordination of exploration/exploitation conditioning and the management
of its innovation potential of attraction.</p>
<p>We propose to simply name this extended model by considering the
<strong>mutual conditioning between exploration and exploitation</strong> as a means
to overcome the fixation effects which are managed at the engineering
design, organizational and environment levels.</p>

<h2 id="synthesis-of-anomalies">Synthesis of anomalies</h2>
<p>The three cases presented in the previous chapter have insisted on
different limitations of the three proposed literature models of
non-mutual conditioning between exploration and exploitation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Adaptive model:</strong> the search-based assumption of exploration is
overstretched by generative processes of different nature and locus.
Exploration is guided by uncertain or unknown (i.e. to be designed)
exploitation constraints as cleverly managed in the icing conditions
detection case. Whereas, it can also be a lock-in despite valuable
generativity on the user experience domain, as several fixation
effects of existing business units are not revisited as presented in
the ADT’s cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interactive model:</strong> creation of meaning and value circulation
among (silent) designers around meetings and prototypes are not
sufficient to sustain radical innovation and the associate unknown
gradual shaping. The business class seat platform shows the
interference and conflicts arising from the exploration/exploitation
handover and agenda differences. It would require a management of
deeper learning mechanisms. Exploration and exploitation are
unfortunately both jeopardized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encapsulated model:</strong> As already stressed in the literature on
project-based management, the need to link project trajectories with
underlying organizational ties, resources and routines is even more
critical at the light of exploration projects searching for
exploitation landing fields. Learning and change management tend to
be dissociated in exploration and exploitation regimes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>Below, we stress the anomalies raised by the cases compared to the
synthetic model portrait in the research questions chapter (p.). As the
reader will notice, some anomalies are reformulations further specifying
the limitations already raised in the literature.</p>
<p>Then, we come back on the different observed anomalies based on the
models predictions by comparison with the actual course of actions. We
start then disentangling these anomalies before formulating our new
model requirements.</p>

<h3 id="generativity-biased-by-explorationexploitation-dichotomy">Generativity biased by exploration/exploitation dichotomy</h3>
<p>First of all, it is important to note again that our research agenda set
from the beginning was to use advances in design reasoning and theory to
understand how generative processes and associated management of unknown
allows revisiting innovation management and the major construct of
ambidexterity. The cases presented earlier show how the models black-box
the nature of generative processes and their interferences with several
managerial dimensions such as: coordination mechanisms, environment
cognition and organization design.</p>
<p>Angela Dumas with Henry Mintzberg (Dumas and Mintzberg

<a href="#ref-Dumas1989">1989</a>) had stressed the importance of <em>silent design</em>
occurring across the organization. The cases reveal how these
distributed design activities can be framed and segregated by what
exploration and exploitation are in an ambidextrous organization.</p>
<p>In the cases of the business class seat and ADT, the generative
processes had used clear exploitation characteristics to base their
exploration: seat packaging, integration and certification issues, and
user pains. It is used as a reference point, but at the same time when
balancing out exploration/exploitation, the generative processes require
an extreme adaption to exploitation organizational constraints despite
having made a strong effort on the cognitive and interactive dimensions.</p>
<p>The exploitation is conducted as if a simple extended or new list of
requirements had been given to the engineering departments. Risks can be
assessed, as well as maturity, but these registers are unfortunately
rather static. They may not capture and manage <em>epistemic
interdependencies</em> accordingly (Puranam, Raveendran, and Knudsen

<a href="#ref-Puranam2012a">2012</a>).</p>
<p>Exploration efforts are then potentially biased by the non-mutual
conditioning. And inversely, the exploitation is heavily burdened by
exploration features that lack articulation with generated novelties.</p>
<h3 id="killing-sustained-innovation-capabilities">Killing sustained innovation capabilities</h3>
<p>The nature of unknown, its management and generativity have been
underestimated in how they collide with adaptive, interactive and
encapsulated models. They stretch the boundaries of these management
models and challenge their viewpoint of collective action. The radical
innovation intent is severed by their limitations.</p>
<p>For instance, among the expected capabilities, the role of leadership,
top management and governance is stressed as being crucial. However, the
actual practice and implementation is rarely discussed in detail. The
different cases showed how management layers took an active role in
projects trajectories. Valuable practices were implemented ranging from
sensemaking, decision-making to sponsorship. These were meant to balance
the contradictions of exploration/exploitation trade-offs and the
results are partially successful and riddled by controversies.</p>
<p>The icing condition detection case creates a critical tension between
its business environment legitimacy and BU strategy and Engineering
appropriation. Following the retirement of the R&amp;T manager, the
researcher had relayed his idea of licensing the technology to an
external firm capable (adequate cost-structure) to develop and
industrialize it for small aircrafts. This move would be a means to
actually set a foot on the aviation market, make a case for it before
fully demonstrating its usefulness for heavier aircrafts enhancing
flight safety. Again, such emergent strategy would be possible by fully
considering separation nor balance of both, as they explore and exploit
interconnected fields.</p>
<h3 id="ignoring-organization-design-and-its-engineering-design-mirror">Ignoring organization design and its engineering design mirror</h3>
<p>Organizational ambidexterity had highlighted ways of structuring the
balancing of exploration/exploitation adding different typologies on how
to sustain a competitive advantage. Oddly, separating it in space, time
or leaving it in context, brings some organization design into play but
only by sketching the organic dimension of it. For example, the
centralization of ADT at the group level or creation of a standalone R&amp;T
team are fully prescribed. It still leaves numerous ties among members
with exploitation activities and extended environment constraints.
However the black-boxing of generative practices into these organic
systems ignores the risks associated with the potential need for
reconfiguration of stakeholders ties. Thus, the dynamics induced by
design practices require, not only a partial-mirroring by organizations,
but rather a mirroring dynamic.</p>
<p>For instance, the required adjustments, in terms of engineering
capabilities to engineer a seat platform architecture, require a
mirroring organization (Colfer and Baldwin 
<a href="#ref-Colfer2016">2016</a>). The
change is not addressed within generative process and with <em>integrators</em>
contributing to <em>interdependence shift</em> (Stan and Puranam

<a href="#ref-Stan2017">2017</a>). The managers in charge of the projects were
acting as integrators. In the case of the seat platform, they a priori
managed to articulate the integration for the Engineering Department and
were later called back for further support. The same goes for ADT:
numerous sessions were organized during the exploration but also after
concept selection to follow up and adapt the preliminary designs trying
to facilitate the integration. As specified in the limitations section
(Stan and Puranam 
<a href="#ref-Stan2017">2017</a>, 1058):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A significant weakness of this study is that it does not provide direct evidence for the micro-mechanisms of how integrators help to cope with interdependence shifts—only that they do (and that these effects are visible even at intermediate performance stages).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of a triple-loop of organizational learning (Leifer and
Steinert 
<a href="#ref-Leifer2011">2011</a>; McClory, Read, and Labib

<a href="#ref-McClory2017">2017</a>), and the regenerative capabilities point in
that direction. But as they engage in a recursive pattern, as discussed
in the literature review, it appears crucial in the case studies to
frame the organization of collective action with practices that are
tightly linked to generative processes. In a more successful way, the
icing conditions detection case shows how future exploitation
constraints (regulation and norms) are shaped to support the technology
search and selection.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="specifying-requirements-for-a-new-model-of-ambidexterity">Specifying requirements for a new model of ambidexterity</h2>
<p>Coming back to our research questions (p.), we have stressed how
organizational ambidexterity can severe radical innovation practices
embodied by different generative processes. One could say that it is the
fault of organizational culture, but we have pointed in ZA’s
presentation (see p.), there are no signs of bad intentions raising
barriers again these radical innovation in the cases presentation and
results. Several practices and management tools were used to circulate
emergent value among stakeholders, including collective decision and
co-design workshops.</p>
<p>So, our first assumption would be to put the emphasis on the
micro-foundations. The nuts and bolts of generative processes and
interactions with value management, action and decision-making would be
absolutely critical to embody ambidextrous management. It fits the
behavioural foundations of March’s agenda (Gavetti, Levinthal, and
Ocasio 
<a href="#ref-Gavetti2007">2007</a>) and it lies at the crossroads of design
theory and reasoning which can be understood as science extending
H.Simon’s work (Simon 
<a href="#ref-Simon1996">1996</a>; Hatchuel

<a href="#ref-Hatchuel2001a">2001</a>). Considering everyone as a designer in its
own way and practice, generating actions, interacting with other
(silent) designers and artefacts, could be a means to think of
generative processes among all of these organs and processes, which call
for a meta-process such as metabolism (Hatchuel, Weil, and Le Masson

<a href="#ref-Hatchuel2006">2006</a>; Segrestin et al. 
<a href="#ref-Segrestin2017">2017</a>).</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    Among our descriptors, we could then propose to consider what could be
explained by a metabolism. We consequently need to target what
contributes to such phenomenon that is neither structure nor traditional
process. Deriving from our observed and justified anomalies, we propose
to recentre organizational ambidexterity around decision-making by
bringing in the teachings of design theory at that level as well as
organizational design. We would then embed some sort hacking of the
constraints and biases induced by exploitation/exploration non-mutual
conditioning. Moreover, it will bring a dynamic mirroring hypothesis as
a means to reflect the organizational change supporting the generative
engineering design.
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="generative-process-and-ambidexterity-micro-foundations">Generative process and ambidexterity micro-foundations</h3>
<p>From the beginning of our literature review up to the cases analyses, we
have discussed the course of action, decision-making and generative
processes. We have justified how organization ambidexterity can kill
sustained innovation management.</p>
<p>So, we have to come back to foundations of the exploration versus
exploitation model whilst also keeping in mind the limitations and
perspectives identified in the interactive and encapsulated models.
The model’s extension we propose to address in the 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part4/">following part</a>, should then almost start from a similar reasoning introduced in the
foundational paper (March 
<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>). However, the
dichotomy of exploration and exploitation should be fully revisited by
considering <strong>a mutual conditioning</strong> of both regimes as it was sketched
by the practices highlighted in the projects’ trajectories.
The nature of problems, their (re-)formulation and solving should be
reworked around the uncertainty and unknown management. Decision and
problem management should be enhanced by generative processes. For
instance, in (Le Glatin, Le Masson, and Weil 
<a href="#ref-LeGlatin2017a">2017</a>)
(see 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/pub-leglatin2017a/">publication</a>, we associate the possibility to deliberately play around the
reversal of preferences to push decision-making into the unknown. We
have proposed to call such pattern <strong>decisional ambidexterity</strong>.
Such practice should aim at identifying fixation effects and their
(epistemic) interdependencies. This <strong>technology of organizing</strong> should
support creation of meaning, value management, engineering and a
baseline for coordination and collective action.</p>
<h3 id="generative-processes-and-organization-design">Generative processes and organization design</h3>
<p>The free-floating of exploration projects, as they look for
organizational ties, should also think through the lens of design theory
and reasoning. The idea of design-oriented organization (Hatchuel, Weil,
and Le Masson 
<a href="#ref-Hatchuel2006">2006</a>) already pointed in that
direction. We need to specify with more clarity the organization design,
as we have seen that assumptions of temporary organization or
project-based organization tend to hide the complexities of changing
engineering design briefs in exploration project management.</p>
<p>Design theories and reasoning are usually discussed for products and
services, but one could consider the organization, its resources and
routines as concept-enabling-knowledge for design. So, the key
requirement of the model is to avoid black-boxing generative processes,
as we have seen they expand onto several management dimensions. We
should then put the emphasis on potential <strong>organization design
fixation</strong> that are not naturally part of the engineering design
practice, nor traditional project management. These are usually
discussed in change (project) management and organizational change but
would probably benefit from richer synergies if embedded in actual
project management (Pollack 
<a href="#ref-Pollack2017">2017</a>; Hornstein

<a href="#ref-Hornstein2015">2015</a>).
Consequently, our <strong>model of mutual conditioning between exploration and
exploitation</strong> should also aim at managing an organizational metabolism
necessary to sustain organization re-design as a necessary condition
supporting the innovation potential of attraction of - so far
black-boxed - generative processes in exploration project management.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="chapter-synthesis">Chapter synthesis</h2>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>Thanks to the previous chapter, we were able to identify literature
models’ weaknesses and several hints given by the case studies. The
synthesis of results reveals, through tracking of generative processes
in projects trajectories, that there is in fact a conditioning managed
or left uncontrolled between exploration and exploitation.</p>
<p>First, we propose to return to the micro-foundations of organizational
ambidexterity as generative processes interfere with several management
dimensions depending on their generativity. Some are indeed more or less
fixated by exploitation constraints, and some are actually actively used
to generate concepts. Therefore, focusing on the model of action,
decision-making and generative processes would be a means to specify how
managers, individual and (silent) designers should interact with such
constraints to manage the generativity of their practice embedded in
projects.</p>
<p>Second, the case studies results encourage to focus on the dynamics of
the mirroring hypothesis, as the generative processes may challenge to
some extent interdependencies that can be catastrophic to exploration
value and subsequent exploitation. Radical innovation fostered by
generative processes may indeed be fixated by organization design, thus
winking at bringing organization design as concept enabling knowledge
supporting product design practices. Change management could be then
brought at the level of product project management and the underlying
generative mechanisms.</p>
<p>Finally, we have a requirements baseline to continue our journey to
design a <strong>model of mutual conditioning between exploration and
exploitation</strong>. We have new grounds extending the studied literature
models and reconnecting ambidexterity with its behavioural foundations
at the light of the teachings of design theory and thinking.</p>
