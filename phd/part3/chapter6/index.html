          <div class="article-style">
            <p>In this first batch of results, we task ourselves to demonstrate an
anomaly in the presented case studies by opposition to the literature
models in our  
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part1/chapter3/">research questions chapter</a>. The results are presented in the same fashion for the three
selected case studies. They are also detailed in different articles in
the 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/">publications</a>.</p>
<p>Systematically, we present the trajectory of the project where we stress
what appears to be a <em>weak signal</em> with respect to generative processes
at stake. It appears as an obstacle for collective action, something
that has created a management issue for involved designers, engineers
and managers. We then propose to use the <strong>adaptive, interactive and
encapsulated</strong> models to <strong>predict</strong> what could have been the course of
action. It will serve as a reference point for the actual course of
action and detect the anomaly with more precision as explained in the

<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter4/">methodology section</a>.</p>

    <p>We first present the analysis of the <em>Icing conditions detection</em> case
(see <a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#icing-conditions-detection">description</a>). It reveals what could be considered as absurd or
even irrational decision-making as depicted in (Le Glatin, Le Masson,
and Weil <a href="#ref-LeGlatin2017a">2017</a><a href="#ref-LeGlatin2017a">b</a>,
<a href="#ref-LeGlatin2017">2017</a><a href="#ref-LeGlatin2017">a</a>), can be accessed in the
appendix (). The product ends up in a paradoxical tension between the
developed technology, its legitimacy and the organizational anchoring.</p>
<p>Second, we present another case of platform engineering exploration for
aircraft seat design: <em>Business Class Seat platform</em> (see <a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#business-class-seat-platform">description</a>), which has been analysed in (Le Glatin, Le Masson, and Weil
<a href="#ref-LeGlatin2018a">2018</a>) and that can be accessed in <a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/pub-leglatin2018a/">publication</a>. The trajectory reveals a transitioning for exploration to
exploitation regime with several difficulties questioning the efficiency
of both exploration and exploitation.</p>
<p>Third and finally, we analyse <em>Airbus Development Team - Design
Thinking</em> cases (see <a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#lower-deck">description</a>). The <em>performance nature</em> of
generative processes is at the heart of this case as discussed in (Le
Glatin et al. <a href="#ref-LeGlatin2018">2018</a>; Le Glatin, Le Masson, and Weil
<a href="#ref-LeGlatin2016">2016</a>) and that can be accessed in <a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/project/design-thinking-for-innovation-management/">publications</a>. Again organizational ambidexterity is challenged by specificities
of generativity causing several complications to enable a sustainable
innovation management.</p>

<h3 id="trajectory-of-the-project">Trajectory of the project</h3>
<p>As described previously in the 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#icing-conditions-detection">methodology sections</a>, the case
was suggested to the researcher for analysis as the R&amp;T manager had
managed the project from the beginning and had increasing pressure on
the conditions of exploitation after the years of exploration and
financial constraints to continue exploration.</p>
<p>The figure.<a href="#fig:IcingTraj" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:IcingTraj">1</a>
below, gives the chronology of the project as it was developed over more
than two decades. The sequence can be followed through the numbers at
the corner of several boxes and years highlighted at the bottom. The
arrows indicate sequence and causality operating for actions, decisions
and the design of decisions. It is, of course, a condensed view of the
history of the project but we can stress the nature of exploration
(disrupt monopoly), when exploitation (client request and market
opportunity) could have occurred and when exploration was launched
again.</p>
<p>The vertical dotted line is the critical part in the project trajectory.
A first exploration was carried out by the project team looking for
alternative solution overcoming limitations known of the monopoly’s
solution. They scouted the field, several test campaigns were conducted
with the support of national laboratories and aircraft manufacturers.
These were proven successful despite some caveats as the first
technology developed addressed only ice detection on ground. However,
another solution was developed with further test campaigns. Regional
aircraft manufacturers were looking for an alternative solution to the
monopoly and possibly for an integrated system: detection and protection
from ice. Restrictions were looming over regional aircrafts as they were
statistically known more sensitive to icing conditions.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, instead of going for this aircraft program and
system/product development between ZFCS and ZEEU that was at hand’s
reach, the current technology development were stopped altogether.
Exploitation promises were discarded, in order to launch a new wave of
exploration addressing yet to be specified icing conditions: new
undefined regulations, scientific knowledge on icing conditions, and
appropriate technology. We propose then to zoom on this key moment of
the project history that balances exploration and exploitation in order
to make sense of it through the lens of literature models.</p>

<p>What our descriptors reveal is that the conducted project does partially
fit some of the models with an emphasis on the interactive and
encapsulated models. The team engaged with the environment’s actors and
pushed the trial-and-error pattern to ensure the legitimation of the
developed technology as well as the primacy/leadership of the newly
reconfigured icing conditions detection market.</p>
<p>However, we see that the exploration is guided by exploitation
constraints that still requires to be fully settled and designed. The
project is at odds with organization design as they have evolved in
autonomy and developed capabilities so far unmatched by legacy
engineering departments. Top management, despite having sponsored the
exploration, still tries to keep the BU <em>together</em> and avoids having a
spin-off. As the technology is not fully mandatory for existing
heavy-body aircraft (statistically proven by manufacturers), it still
requires to make a case for itself beyond small/regional aircraft
market. The BU strategy is thus challenged by this market re-orientation
and the lack of technology-market fitness.</p>
<h4 id="lone-irrational-entrepreneur">Lone irrational entrepreneur?</h4>
<p>One could argue the R&amp;T manager used foolishness (March

<a href="#ref-March2006">2006</a>) to refuse the first exploitation opportunity
benefiting from synergies with another BU. He is however a sane spirit
in a sane body.</p>
<p>The adaptation of technology is performed dynamically with the
environment being shaped by managing safety regulation and norms as well
as technology legitimation. Exploration of technologies and product
concept are guided by generating and refining alternatives of what
exploitation (regulation and standard) could be.</p>
<p>The non-mutual conditioning of the regimes is compromised, but brings
new hopes for exploitation. As discussed in (Le Glatin, Le Masson, and
Weil 
<a href="#ref-LeGlatin2017a">2017</a>
<a href="#ref-LeGlatin2017a">b</a>, see 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/pub-leglatin2017a/">publication</a>), preferences were reversed, representing a violation of rational theory
of choice, but at the same time allowed uncovering prospective
alternatives requiring a contingent environment management.
This entrepreneurial effort is not isolated, it was sustained through a
rich engagement with the environment, learning for the R&amp;T team, but
also support from BU management and top management.</p>
<h4 id="new-bu-for-zssm">New BU for ZSSM?</h4>
<p>This offshoot generated by the R&amp;T team dedicated to icing conditions
detection was established as a young product line. The issue for top
management is the absence of a clearly defined market for heavy-body
aircraft, which are the <em>norm</em> for other products in the BU.</p>
<p>It is probably the paradox of this exploration project and the autonomy
gained through open innovation practice, path constitution and funding
schemes. It is abnormal for the three models, as the top management
sponsored the emergent strategy from the beginning, and steered the
process along the way as a strong technological advantage could be
developed to overcome the monopoly.</p>
<p>In the end, exploitation is shifted from its standard belief and
conception to market the product, from a marketing and engineering
standpoint. In fact, the prototype developed and tested by R&amp;T implies a
lot of rework for development engineering, in terms of robustness,
quality and manufacturing engineering. Nevertheless, the prototype can
also be seen as a means to support learning of the new technology so far
unfamiliar to the engineering department.</p>
<p>Creating a new BU appeared out of the equation. BU management preferred
to capitalize on the exploration and develop the new technology on the
shelf. They also allowed with external funding to let the new technology
version to be further explored as the norms and regulations being
co-managed by the R&amp;T manager have created new slots requiring applied
research and product development to ensure aircraft safety and
airworthiness.</p>

<h2 id="a-seat-platform-poor-exploration-management">A seat platform: poor exploration management?</h2>
<h3 id="trajectory-of-the-project-1">Trajectory of the project</h3>
<p>As described previously in the 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#business-class-seat-platform">case presentation</a>, the
researcher was encouraged to have a closer look to this seat design
after we had organized several meetings and workshops to support the BU
in implementing their own management tools and practice to evaluate TRL
for R&amp;T projects and support handovers with Development Engineering.
This Business Class seat platform project, not only raised the
assessment issue for isolated technologies and its integration, but
rather emphasised the criticality of design robustness as a system to
meet requirements.</p>
<p>The figure
<a href="#fig:BCTraj" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:BCTraj">2</a>
below, gives the chronology of the project as it was developed over more
than two years. The sequence can be followed through the numbers at the
corner of several boxes and years highlighted at the bottom. The arrows
indicate sequence and causality operating for actions, decisions and the
design of decisions. It is a condensed view of the history of the
project but we can stress the nature of exploration (platform envelop
definition and selection) and the shift towards exploitation requested
by a demanding client.</p>
<p>The vertical dotted line is the critical part in the project trajectory.
A first exploration was carried out by the project team looking for
alternative solution overcoming limitations of packaging and
certification for business class (BC) seat. Several options were found
in the market (patents, competition benchmark) and they designed several
alternatives before elaborating criteria with BU stakeholders to decide
on the concept. They ended up with a seat architecture sharing a frame
with neighbouring seat (like a bench) supporting their own load and a
shell providing volume and several valuable BC features. The modular
design puts the emphasis on the seat lower frame as being the core on
which all other modules would plug in (foot rest, backrest, shell,
etc.).</p>
<p>This is when sales and program management teams saw the attractivity of
the product with a greater living space which seduced a demanding
client. The concept design was then selected by the client and further
refined with their own design studio. However, this shift from
exploration to exploitation revealed several complications in the design
architecture. For instance, the 3 legged seat and the load of both seat
and shell packaged together as whole for certification (i.e. airworthy
and safe for passenger) raised the mechanical engineering complexity.
This a priori successful balance from exploration to exploitation came
out to be quite disastrous: quality issues, delays, engineering cost
overruns, and jeopardized seat platform.</p>

<p>This comparison shows that the actual course of action is far more
complex and raises again numerous obstacles the literature models would
not have fully grasped. For instance, the decision-making process
organized during the exploration phase was used not only to select a
platform design, but also as a basis to generate new alternatives in
between decision meetings.</p>
<p>The transition from exploration to exploitation was seen from the angle
of the client who identified a feature (increased living space and leg
space) in the platform seat (with its enhanced packaging and
certification). However, the difficulties were treated by the
Engineering department requiring to call back R&amp;T engineer to support
them. There is then an overlap of the influences between exploration and
exploitation.</p>
<h4 id="lack-robust-design-practice-between-rt-and-development">Lack robust design practice between R&amp;T and Development?</h4>
<p>One could argue that the engineering is overall of poor quality. It is
an argument hard to sustain as the BU is one of the market leaders and
pioneered several designs. Moreover, the product development is
conducted in short time period (2 years approximately) and it requires a
lot of flexibility within engineering departments to support the design
and development. The researcher had the occasion on multiple occasions
to witness the density of relationships and knowledge sharing within a
project’s scope.</p>
<p>Together with the Engineering Director, ex-post reviews were conducted
to evaluate the maturity and robustness of the design during the
exploitation phase (client’s program gates). It revealed that the
several mechanical issues relating to the interference of the platform
design and client requirements were understood late in the development
process. The researcher found that traditional product development (i.e.
no modularity) relies a lot on the physical testing conducted quite late
in the process due to parts availability<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. However, simulation test
engineers had flagged several flaws of the design, but were not heard by
development engineering preferring to witness the physical test, whereas
they were by R&amp;T engineers during the exploration phase.</p>
<p>Finally, it is not a complete failure as teachings have been transferred
to R&amp;T team and advanced concept team (group of internal designers and
engineers) to study again the possibility to develop a new modular
design, with more emphasis on the shell design. Another topic on
modularity was also launched by the R&amp;T team approaching the concept
differently, for instance, not in seat-centric way.</p>
<h4 id="too-early-explorationexploitation-transition">Too early exploration/exploitation transition?</h4>
<p>One could also argue the project was handed over to quickly to the
engineering department. However, it is not really the case as the
selection of concepts was made collectively and interactively with BU
stakeholder. The client’s request for proposal and bid award was an
actual great opportunity to value the exploration phase conducted by the
R&amp;T team.</p>
<p>What is perhaps missing is the weakness in countering the demanding
client’s request which have pushed the physical limits of the platform
design. Why not using the client’s opportunity and constraints to
develop in parallel a full platform design instead of trying to keep
some complicated associated features (e.g. totally new compact seat
kinematic)?</p>
<p>The exploration and exploitation were put on a same continuum, being
perhaps overlapped at the beginning of the project. Later, it
unfortunately over-complexified the product design and development, to a
point where the innovation effort in the platform design is killed by
switching to a normalized exploitation regime. When discussing with
engineers and managers why some alternatives had been discarded
(designed by the researcher with C-K Theory, see (Le Glatin, Le Masson,
and Weil 
<a href="#ref-LeGlatin2018a">2018</a>, see 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/pub-leglatin2018a/">publication</a>),
signs of regret were identified explaining the difficulty to identify
and articulate the exploration/exploitation divide earlier in design
practices.</p>

<h3 id="trajectory-of-the-project-2">Trajectory of the project</h3>
<p>The last case we are presenting here is the synthesis of 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#airbus-development-team---design-thinking-cases">two projects
managed by the Airbus Development Team</a>. The researcher had the
occasion to analyse two projects led by two different members (engineer
and designer) who had been trained to Design Thinking. The other ADT
participants had been also introduced, if not trained to it, like it was
the case of ADT’s manager. The latter had given access to all
documentation available on their server and requested his colleagues to
save some time for my interviews. The team had been tasked to generate
proposals valuing BU’s know-how and combined synergies in the form of
Multi-BU projects. They usually referred to the recurrent argument of
the <em>not-invented here syndrome</em> or <em>resistance to change</em> to explain
the absence of follow-up by BUs to develop their generated concepts.</p>
<p>However, they stressed some cases where BUs were thrilled by having
opened their eyes to the competencies of sister BUs in the group,
unlocking interdependencies between products that are usually hidden by
market segmentation and sales channels. The projects based on Design
Thinking adapted the method to have BUs not only learn from user
knowledge, but also to have multi-BU design workshops.</p>
<p>As presented in the 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/project/design-thinking-for-innovation-management/">publications on Design Thinking</a>, the cases were analysed with the help of C-K design theory in
order to understand the performance of the generative processes in the
projects and their impact for BUs (ADT’s mission). The C-K mappings were
synthesized from control groups of students from Mines ParisTech. The
figure
<a href="#fig:ADTTraj" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:ADTTraj">3</a>
below shows the synthesis of the projects’ trajectory. Both design
briefs (Better Waste Management and Turn Around Time Optimization)
followed the same pattern as they had defined a methodology canvas
adapted from their practice, experience and Design Thinking.</p>
<p>Our focus is on the output of the projects as they come to a standstill.
If Design Thinking may not be the key to everything, it is worth
understanding the relationship between the nature of generative
processes and their organization impact: concept appropriation and
development by business units.</p>
<p>In our 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/project/ambidexterity-exploration-exploitation/">publications on ambidexterity</a>, this transition from exploration to an absence of exploitation is
analysed. Below, we propose rephrasing it with descriptors and models’
predictions derived from our literature review. The trajectory is
summarized in figure
<a href="#fig:ADTTraj" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:ADTTraj">3</a>,
and they strech over less than a year (approximately 8 months).</p>

<p>The comparison of the actual course of action with the models’
prediction reveals again the necessity to understand the
micro-foundations of exploration and exploitation, and their balance.
The generative process practice of Design Thinking gives an idea of the
direction of generativity and how it tries to build to innovation
potential of attraction through demonstrated user and client value.</p>
<p>However, none of the business units were interested in actually
committing to pushing the concepts further. They had accepted the
concepts and recognized their interest and client value. They had even
co-designed the concepts with ADT members, validated by VP Business
Development sponsorship.</p>
<p>The exploration opened the path to new knowledge and better awareness of
the environment and system thinking. Opportunities of connecting BUs
together, through concepts revisiting interdependencies, were identified
as they would be usually hidden behind their traditional market and
product perspective. Nevertheless, the models fail in explaining why the
concepts are not developed by BUs as we discuss below.</p>
<h4 id="co-design-acceptance-and-no-follow-up">Co-design, acceptance and no follow-up</h4>
<p>The <em>non-invented here syndrome</em> could be of course flagged as being the
main reason for BUs not accepting to making these concepts their own.
Indeed, no project lines were added to the budget by Business Unit. Only
one added a line, but with zero budget, meaning they would perhaps
consider a paper study. The <em>death valley</em> argument (Markham et al.

<a href="#ref-Markham2010">2010</a>) is also not really valid as BU can budget the
project, and budget consolidation is discussed with group CTO, ExCom and
each BU manager to decide how they size the budget with support from the
holding’s budget.</p>
<p>What is even more surprising is the fact that engineers, designers and
managers from BUs participated to co-design workshops with other BUs.
They legitimized and made sense of the concepts themselves in addition
to welcoming the shared knowledge on users and value chain.</p>
<h4 id="exploring-alternative-aircraft-spaces">Exploring alternative aircraft spaces</h4>
<p>Finally, the concepts generated with Design Thinking, as presented in

<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/project/design-thinking-for-innovation-management/">our publication</a>, were designed as if for BUs wouldn’t change. Moreover, the
decision process to rank and select concepts in order to be promoted to
BUs reinforced the stability of existing boundaries and engineering
capabilities, as well as markets domains.</p>
<p>In some other cases, concepts generated through <em>What Ifs? scenario</em>
allowed relieving some operational constraints (e.g. passengers storing
their personal luggage in containers, passengers participating to waste
sorting). These concepts unlocked interdependencies between aircraft
equipment and engineering as seen in C-K reference mapping. However, the
concepts were promoted as if BUs could just adapt them, without
emphasizing the radicality of the new perspective implying deep
reconfiguration of engineering design, system architecture and market
positioning.</p>
<p>We have overall a good example of ambidextrous organization with a
supportive top management leadership, a valuable generative process,
deep interactions at different management levels. But, our literature
models fail to explain the absence of further product development or
even re-use of a feature in their technology and product roadmaps.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="chapter-synthesis">Chapter synthesis</h2>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>Based on the methodology designed for our research questions, we have
taken each case individually by identifying a critical snapshot in the
project trajectories where the adaptive, interactive and encapsulated
models where used for predictions. By categorizing these with our
descriptors, and comparing them with the actual course of action, we
have spotted anomalies and discussed their justification.</p>
<p>Firstly, we have demonstrated the fact that ambidexterity actually kills
innovation, which answers our first research question. We have also
managed to specify the different obstacles revealed by the analysis
supported by design theory and engineering bringing the necessity for an
micro-approach to the balancing of exploration and exploitation. Several
biases and fixations effects stem from the <em>non-mutual conditioning</em>
between these two regimes, which appears to be no longer valid in the
unknown and high uncertainties.</p>
<p>Secondly, we have also stressed that the black-boxing of generative
processes within projects can later create controversies for middle/top
management as well as strategic coherence. Indeed, the separation of
exploration from exploitation at the organizational levels tends to
bring and reinforce <strong>organization design fixations</strong>. It does not
encourage taking them into account within generative processes to value
the necessary change dynamics among resources nor the routines
supporting engineering practices.</p>
<p>Finally, these results, specified in different ways through intra and
inter BU cases, give several hints to try to overcome the literature
models’ limitations to design an extended model reconciling with the
observed anomalies. Our aim would be to reconnect the ambidexterity
models with the unknown since innovation management has developed in
ways that the original non-mutual conditioning has lost ground.</p>
