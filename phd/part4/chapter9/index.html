<p><em>The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social
decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and
the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it
is intended to monitor.</em> (Campbell 
<a href="#ref-Campbell1979">1979</a>, 85)
<strong>Donald T. Campbell</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this second modelling chapter, we have to fill in the gaps for the
model requirements we have defined for ourselves at the end of the

<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part3/chapter6/">anomaly detection chapter</a>. The definition and specification of decisional ambidexterity in
the previous chapter addressed some of the descriptors used earlier in
our methodological approach. The organizational dimension was not fully
discussed as we have mainly stressed the decision-designing to revisit
the mutual conditioning between exploration and exploitation in order to
start anew with organizational ambidexterity.</p>
<p>Recalling our review on project based management, interactionism and
organization design, we will build upon limitations previously
identified to complete our decisional ambidexterity model.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    First, we discuss the question of simultaneity where (exploration)
project management should consider also the change management (Pollack
<a href="#ref-Pollack2017">2017</a>; Hornstein <a href="#ref-Hornstein2015">2015</a>). It will
enable us to take into account the mirroring hypothesis (Colfer and
Baldwin <a href="#ref-Colfer2016">2016</a>) and its dynamics as fixation effects
and interdependencies are seen in engineering design and organizational
dimensions. Second, we will come back to concept organizational
metabolism (Hatchuel, Weil, and Le Masson <a href="#ref-Hatchuel2006">2006</a>;
Segrestin et al. <a href="#ref-Segrestin2017">2017</a>) allowing overcoming the
iterations of traditional double bind of structure and processes.

<p>The different cases presented in the anomaly detection chapter revealed
several tensions associated with the encapsulation of generative
processes and their potential free-floating across organizations (Lenfle

<a href="#ref-Lenfle2016">2016</a>). Decisional ambidexterity allows focusing on
the micro-foundations of exploration/exploitation dichotomy: revisiting
the decision-making by considering decision-design permits touching upon
one of the key aspects of coordination and collective action organizing
for innovation. The way action is engaged, the way decisions are made,
and the way organization members network (Christiansen and Varnes

<a href="#ref-Christiansen2007">2007</a>) can be captured through the
decision-design in the C-K formalism.</p>
<p>The transformation, due to exploration, or the one faced in exploitation
because of the unexpected, can imply an active role for
decision-designers as they play on states of nature, the degrees of
beliefs and the cost functions will be redefined. Consequently, at the
project management level depending on the framing imposed to the
decision-design and the underlying engineering brief, the
interdependencies can be controlled or even avoided depending on the
aimed independence level. The latter will contribute to the innovation
potential of attraction at the organizational level: how business units
will host, support, redesign their organizations or recombine their
capabilities for such projects. As we remember, we are not interested in
spin-off and other ad-hoc phenomena, we want the organization to
regenerate itself &ldquo;within its boundaries&rdquo; by relying on its
organizational metabolism.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    We start discussing the implications of decisional ambidexterity for
project management, as it will design decisions at the project level
that can quickly address several interdependencies reaching out for
permanent organizations. Then, the mirroring hypothesis gives an idea of
the relationships behind revisited design rules and interdependencies
and their organization. Modularity/genericity is an answer corresponding
to one decision category but doesn’t allow getting a full picture.

<h3 id="project-management-product-or-organizational-change">Project management: product or organizational change?</h3>
<h4 id="uncertaintyunknown-buffer-to-manage-the-ecosystem-relationship">Uncertainty/Unknown buffer to manage the ecosystem relationship</h4>
<p>We had specified that the project-based organization was probably an
efficient way of organizing the firm to face uncertainties. Projects can
be seen as uncertainty buffers (Davies, Manning, and Söderlund

<a href="#ref-Davies2018">2018</a>, 971):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>integrate cross-functional resources and knowledge to cope with high
uncertainty, complexity and change</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, we remember that when pushing this form into the unknown
reveals several difficulties that are exacerbated in cases where the
organization’s identity and boundaries are tied by market rigidities
tightly linked to product engineering. Zodiac Aerospace is a proper
example of such pattern.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Icing Conditions Detection case was a vehicle to shape the unknown,
an example of decisional ambidexterity, by playing on preferences’ order
to value the unknown and manage the ecosystem. It built its own autonomy
through public funding and legitimation with key industrial players. It
allowed more flexibility compared to a traditional exploration that
would have been fully hosted by an engineering or product development
department with a functional form. Just like in the two other cases
analysed previously, the projects were sponsored by middle and top
management, sometimes even having a key isolated position from other
routines. It gives freedom to operate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The relationship to the environment and the ways projects engage with it
relocates organizational adaptation and learning at the project level in
a temporary organization, whereas organizational ambidexterity would
have a tendency to materialise it in a permanent organization.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    In a sense, enforcing institutionalization (O’Connor
<a href="#ref-OConnor2016">2016</a>) of innovation function or organizational
ambidexterity could be dangerous for the firm’s cohesion and coherent
action. Specially, if it is not sustained by clear managerial action and
engineering at the project level that clearly embeds the change
management and adaptation to the environment. Decisional ambidexterity
allows then reconciliating this change of locus.
  </div>
</div>
<h4 id="a-vehicle-for-change-which-manageable-parameters">A vehicle for change: which manageable parameters?</h4>
<p>The necessity of change appears as the interdependencies have shifted
(Stan and Puranam 
<a href="#ref-Stan2017">2017</a>). It is deep down what makes
management a reality. Organizing collective action is necessary only at
the wake of novelty forcing a transformational experience.
If the project brings some novelty through decisional ambidexterity it
will rely on existing interdependencies (exploitation) to generate new
alternatives. The mutual conditioning is required to surface and manage
interdependencies.</p>
<p>When discussing the interface between design and manufacturing
activities in (Adler 
<a href="#ref-Adler1995">1995</a>), the author targets the
cruciality of coordination mechanisms around interdependencies defined
by the new product development. Mutual adjustment and interaction models
will vary depending on the analysability of product/process fit. It is
key to be able to reflect the organizational change required for the
engineering interdependencies as they will be directly used as
springboards to articulate the mutual conditioning between exploration
and exploitation.</p>
<p>As new decisions are designed along projects trajectories, they can
phase out compared to established organizations. It forces to conform
the project to the host and permanent organization. It can even
(implicitly) consider that the host or integrating BU would not change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Design Thinking projects, as well as the BC seat platform, when
transferring the designed products and made decisions, they faced the
exploitation regime in permanent organizations with established
engineering design rules. The learning and organizational change was not
on the menu of the project nor handover with the redesign of
decision-making.</p>
<p>For instance, ADT did try to refine designs, but it was rather an
optimization effort instead of playing on states of nature to envision
the required change in engineering constraints, product interfaces,
standards, regulations, market segmentation, business models, etc. For
the seat platform, the learning and design rules evolution came after
relying on late and repeated mechanical tests which confirmed previously
discussed but underestimated numerical simulations.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    In order to embed the organizational change management within project
management (Pollack <a href="#ref-Pollack2017">2017</a>; Hornstein
<a href="#ref-Hornstein2015">2015</a>), we must then clarify how the engineering
interdependencies and fixation effects are dealt with at the
organizational level. In (Stjerne and Svejenova
<a href="#ref-Stjerne2016">2016</a>), the work at the boundaries of temporary
organizations lets overcoming the dialectics of temporary and permanent
organizing. It brings a multi-level perspective we propose to channel
through decision design: decisional ambidexterity.
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="mirroring-hypothesis-a-static-view">Mirroring hypothesis: a static view</h3>
<p>We had identified in the literature the mirroring hypothesis (Colfer and
Baldwin 
<a href="#ref-Colfer2016">2016</a>). We could a priori use decisional
ambidexterity in exploration project management that considers existing
product design architecture as a starting point. It would involve a
number of design rules reflecting the managerial technology. Behind the
scenes, sensemaking interprets and adapts to make actual practice
(Christiansen and Varnes 
<a href="#ref-Christiansen2009">2009</a>) giving some
flexibility to the rules. So the (partial) mirroring is obtained through
established technologies of organizing which can have different levels
of independence, hence clustering the sub-organizations for product
sub-systems.</p>
<h4 id="modularity">Modularity</h4>
<p>Modularity and loosed coupling (Sanchez and Mahoney

<a href="#ref-Sanchez1996">1996</a>) can then be the purpose of decision-design in
order to be able to adapt easily and reached strategic flexibility.
Instead of being seen as an adaptation to the environment turbulences,
it could also be actively co-designed from the product engineering
perspective. Having such approach to modularity could also be envisioned
temporarily before reintegration (Siggelkow and Levinthal

<a href="#ref-Siggelkow2003">2003</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the BC seat platform project, the aim was to define an architecture
and organize modularity. However, such effort was not reached and
practices of exploitation took over. The existing interdependencies as
well as evolving standards with the modularity choices taken were not
made clear to stakeholders to redefine its mirroring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Platform engineering, or designing a <em>wishful decision by genericity</em>,
is an exploration effort as per which exploitation constraints and
parameters can be built upon to define new design rules, and
consequently organize engineering departments, manufacturing as well as
supply chain.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    Therefore, in the knowledge space defined in our C-K modelling of
decisional ambidexterity, it would be useful to add the organizational
partial mirroring of interdependencies as these will require to be
transformed due to the product engineering practice. These are decision
parameters that can be resurfaced and explicitly related to organization
design.
  </div>
</div>
<h4 id="stress-testing-absorbing-uncertaintyunknown">Stress testing: absorbing uncertainty/unknown?</h4>
<p>The perspective of modularity and genericity, which is one of the
decisions $d^{gen}$ in our model, brings the possibility of managing
double unknown situations (Kokshagina et al.

<a href="#ref-Kokshagina2016a">2016</a>) specially through adapted portfolio
management. In a similar way, (Hooge et al. 
<a href="#ref-Hooge2014">2014</a>), and
closer to our concern for decision-design, they showcase the anomaly of
willing designing a generic technology to bridge a gap between distant
fields and technologies, by opposition to the common evolutionary
strategies. Difficulties are raised regarding the sophisticated
organizational patterns, and capacity to reuse and connect existing
technologies.</p>
<p>Consequently, when considering how the mirroring of interdependencies
enacted by members of the organization, the knowledge mobilised in
decision-design will require a precise understanding of the levels of
independence between elements, boundaries and purpose of each group of
other decision-designers involved.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    Genericity and modularity will allow absorbing uncertainty quite easily,
but once the unknown slips through sub-systems, their
inter-relationships are heavily discussed. Decisional-ambidexterity
should then be able to specify and support these dynamics. In that
sense, the mirroring hypothesis is too static and perhaps only looking
at robustness and adaptive flexibility as the unknown is usually seen as
exogenous.
  </div>
</div>
<hr>
<h2 id="endogenizing-the-unknown-dynamically-designing-projects-and-organizations">Endogenizing the unknown: dynamically designing projects and organizations</h2>
<p>Decisional ambidexterity encourages then to fully endogenize the unknown
into project management to address how it can be shaped into
organizations through the dynamics of interdependencies mirroring
exploitation product engineering.</p>
<p>We then propose to make organization design part of the decision-design
model with underlying interdependencies and fixation effects. It will
help specifying the nature of decisions covering contingencies that may
lie in the intricacies of interdependencies. These should effectively be
redesigned depending on the generativity of processes used to propose
new alternatives. The latter being one of the issues at stake revealed
by the biases induced by organizational ambidexterity and its model of
non-mutual conditioning against innovation initiatives.</p>
<p>The model of <strong>decisional ambidexterity</strong> for mutual conditioning
between exploration and exploitation focuses now on decision-designing
as well as organization. Consequently, this <strong>technology of organizing</strong>
that simultaneously aims at supporting innovation project management and
change management, will spread out and ripple through established
processes and structures and hence contributing to the <strong>metabolism of
an innovative organization</strong>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    We first discuss organization design in the unknown and how to overcome
organization design fixations. Generative learning sustained through
decision design can support disentanglement of interdependencies and
fixations. Then, we introduce the necessity to overtake the duality of
structure and processes. We focus on how decisional ambidexterity can
sustain organizational metabolism.
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="organization-design-in-the-unknown-and-against-organizational-fixation">Organization design in the unknown and against organizational fixation</h3>
<p>Organization design requires to be thought differently at the light of
decisional ambidexterity, as we force to bring the unknown and its
management at the level of projects and interactions around
decision-making, now decision-designing. The potential of transformation
and attraction, channelled through extended decision spaces, gives a new
flavour to the organization design features specially for
interdependencies and fixations effects.</p>
<h4 id="the-unknown-organization-design">The unknown organization design</h4>
<p>The difficulty for standard organization design is when considering
unknown information of unknown value, as the necessity to establish
relationships between agents is hard to justify (Puranam, Raveendran,
and Knudsen 
<a href="#ref-Puranam2012a">2012</a>). And it is not only by having
people together that they will be able to solve new problems, let aside
formulating new problems themselves. When trying to foresee the future
of organization design when facing the unknown, the importance of having
a new method for normative field becomes critical (Puranam

<a href="#ref-Puranam2012">2012</a>). The methodology developed over several
decades in design theory and reasoning can fortuitously support such
initiative.</p>
<p>By considering the importance of action, interaction and decision in
organizations, we can centralize such key phenomena into organization
design. The contributions of (silent) decision-designers continuously
referring to exploitation will help valuing exploration and vice-versa.
The multiple interactions required to make sense of decisions, product
design and engineering design rules become quite attractive for
organizational studies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the Design Thinking projects, concepts wouldn’t fit BUs or even
multi-BU prospects. Engineering rules had to change, product lines and
BUs respective boundaries were contested through the designed and
selected concepts by ADT, group VP of Strategy and Business Development,
and during multi-BU workshops. The confrontation and adaptation would
only rely on a separation of exploration/exploitation regimes.
Generative processes were guided by product design objectives, as well
as environment perspectives (user value and empathy) but failed to
address the potential organization redesign.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Placing the unknown right at the centre of organization design can
probably overcome caveats of simple solutions or adjustments that only
have a concern for: balance of hierarchical control, individual autonomy
and spontaneous cooperation (Keidel 
<a href="#ref-Keidel1994">1994</a>). A
<strong>technology of organizing</strong> could then substantiate the <em>generative
learning</em> (Senge 
<a href="#ref-Senge1990">1990</a>) by deriving from the decisional
ambidexterity model. Such device could help have a better understanding
of required organization design and its <em>generative fit</em> (Avital and
Te’eni 
<a href="#ref-Avital2009">2009</a>; Van de Ven, Ganco, and Hinings

<a href="#ref-VandeVen2013">2013</a>).</p>
<p>Learning can then be overseen in our model as it will have to be
challenged as interdependencies will be unlocked, reinforced or
reconfigured depending on how the decision-designers explore
exploitation and exploit exploration.</p>
<h4 id="managing-interdependencies-and-organization-fixation-effects">Managing interdependencies and organization fixation effects</h4>
<p>In the context of meta-organizations (Gulati, Puranam, and Tushman

<a href="#ref-Gulati2012">2012</a>) and also open-innovation, rethinking of
organization design can not be seen as fully transposed to problem/task
decomposition by leadership (Lakhani, Lifshitz-Assaf, and Tushman

<a href="#ref-Lakhani2013">2013</a>). We have seen that the identity of
organization can be so strong due to engineering and regulations, that
problem formulation in exploration project management can escape from
the attraction of organization competence. So, trying to keeping it
together, and build new coherence through the transformation triggered
by design activities, requires to shift the locus of change down to the
micro-level of interdependencies and fixation effects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Icing Conditions detection, the BU manager ended up having a
valuable exploration project recognized in the industrial ecosystem but
at odds with the organization. Again, we have a case where the
exploration was driven by several expansive decisions changing the game
but the interdependencies with systems engineering mastered with the
business have to be reworked. The transferred unfinished but flight
tested product should be seen as a learning device rather than fit for
development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fixation effects could be associated to the state-of-art in product
development, and the gradual convergence towards a common consensus,
which may be biased.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    The constitution of new path will have to emerge through the
interactions created by discussing the value of designed decisions and
concepts anchored to dominant design. These interactions will support
the organization change that is required to support new business
development (Simon and Tellier <a href="#ref-Simon2018">2018</a>): resources and
development of capabilities mobilized around a project. It confirms the
networking dimension that can be organized around alleged decision
meetings (Christiansen and Varnes <a href="#ref-Christiansen2007">2007</a>).
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="sustaining-metabolisms-regenerating-the-organization">Sustaining metabolisms: regenerating the organization</h3>
<p>As discussed in the anomalies specification (chapter
<a href="#chap:anomalies_spec" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="chap:anomalies_spec">[chap:anomalies_spec]</a>),
embedding change management within project management calls for
phenomena rippling across structures and processes, as we propose to do
with centrality of action, decision and design for organizing. The
biological metaphor of metabolisms allows targeting &ldquo;processes&rdquo; that are
tied by the double bind of structure and processes. It puts the emphasis
on the <em>actionable knowledge</em> and relationships (Segrestin et al.

<a href="#ref-Segrestin2017">2017</a>), instead of separating management of
structure and process. The constructs of regenerative capabilities and
recombination of routines in organization can be then further
substantiated with decisional ambidexterity and organizational
metabolism.</p>
<h4 id="regenerative-dynamic-capabilities">Regenerative dynamic capabilities</h4>
<p>The difficulty associated with the innovation function distributed
across projects (Gemünden, Lehner, and Kock 
<a href="#ref-Gemunden2018">2018</a>)
goes to the distributed nature of capabilities. Making the sum won’t be
representative of the overall capabilities available in underlying host
functional departments. However, by considering they will be organizing
their trajectory around decision-design with supplying departments,
other business units, as well as external players, can create a pivotal
force for stakeholders to understand in which direction change should
occur.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the BC seat platform project, in the early stages of defining the
extent and features of genericity, several stakeholders took part in
designing concepts, even marginally, but also to designing what had to
be decided. The sense made out of those meetings, and its contribution
to generating alternatives, represents a capability to regenerate seat
engineering. Unfortunately, a similar effort was not sustained when
switching from exploration to exploitation due to a strong divide
enforced by ambidexterity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As teams and organization will cope with these different temporalities,
first locally at the project level, and then at the program level (Simon
and Tellier 
<a href="#ref-Simon2016">2016</a>), it gives us confidence on the value
of our model. Temporary-organizing will reach a meta-equilibrium during
when designing-decisions, as they make sense and rethink the new
coordination mechanisms supporting the new product development. We
contribute then to the idea of having regenerative capabilities
(Ambrosini, Bowman, and Collier 
<a href="#ref-Ambrosini2009">2009</a>, S15)
supported by decisional ambidexterity.</p>
<h4 id="recombining-routines">Recombining routines</h4>
<p>In a similar way, the idea of recombining routines (Cohendet and Simon

<a href="#ref-Cohendet2016">2016</a>) fostered by a single project, can be the
occasion to rethink product design rules that have been fixated for some
time. In their case, they specify the importance of meetings held,
prototypes and proof of concepts that were tailored and managed by
project manager to make a case for a radical product concept, at odds
with exploitation regime. Resurfacing interdependencies and design
fixation with such practices can be a means to make tacit the designing
of decisions and learning mechanisms that can be mapped with C-K theory
as we did in the previous chapter.</p>
<p>What is also stimulating here is that, innovation management does
necessarily have to supported by additional routines. Within a set of
routines, they can be reconfigured to create <em>more</em> value, as if the
scales and units changed in nature. It is what we tried to picture with
the Pareto front and reaching out for alternatives (see
p.<a href="#fig:explorationregimesb" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:explorationregimesb">[fig:explorationregimesb]</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Design Thinking cases, some concepts actually implied recombining
routines across business units who were traditionally segregated by the
market and engineering standards. Focusing on the product and design
rules would only force adaptation, whereas the obstacle was rather on
elevating interactions on the how and its legitimacy for users, but also
the remaining effort: change in sales pitch, market channel, one-time
qualification, evolving standards and certification forms, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, it would be such contextuality that could be associated with
contextual ambidexterity but detailed in its interaction modes
(Birkinshaw and Gupta 
<a href="#ref-Birkinshaw2013">2013</a>). It would now make
more sense with the limitations on the nature and dichotomy of
exploration/exploitation regimes discussed in the very same paper and in
(Gupta, Smith, and Shalley 
<a href="#ref-Gupta2006">2006</a>).</p>
<p>The networking effect (Christiansen and Varnes

<a href="#ref-Christiansen2007">2007</a>) can easily be structured around the
dialogue interdependent and fixation knots. It encourages channelling
the access to (distant) knowledge, legitimize the mutual conditioning
between exploration and exploitation (Simon and Tellier

<a href="#ref-Simon2011a">2011</a>). But here again, we insist on the technology of
organizing collective action through decisional ambidexterity
facilitating the grounding of such interactive patterns.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    So far, we have proposed then to embed the organization design within
our decisional ambidexterity. We have emphasized the need to organize
the decision-design around exploitation constraints such as
interdependencies and fixation effects, not only at the product
engineering level, but also at the organizational level. Routines and
capabilities can be articulated around the designed decision to sustain
the <em>metabolism</em> triggered by associated concepts. These elements
contribute to making its <em>innovation potential of attraction</em> dragging
along not only a cognitive fit, but also an organizational generative
fit.
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="full-model-synthesis">Full model synthesis</h3>
<p>We have then specified the interest of having organization design
embedded in the designing of decisions, by considering that
organizations are part of the knowledge required to enact decision
concepts. Consequently, we propose simply to represent in the C-K
formalism what makes decision and its hypotheses with organizational
ties and mirroring: interdependencies and fixation effects. They are the
translation at the organizational level that can be easily disturbed by
generative processes: i.e. where tension and anomalies come from between
models of ambidexterity and exploration project management. In other
words, we insist once again on the link between actionable knowledge and
relationships, and how it can metabolize innovation in the organization
with its structure and processes.</p>

<p>Listing the engineering design fixations, interdependencies and built-in
product architecture, will help addressing the regenerative dynamic
capabilities and recombination of routines required to manage the
organizational metabolism. The change management will then be steered
through the inter-relationships bearing generative learning triggered by
the collective decision-designing. It is again the mutual conditioning
of exploration and exploitation which allows simply measuring change.
In the following table

we can complete the model synthesis with the descriptors derived from
previous literature review. We remember the synthetic literature model
of non-mutual conditioning enabling its comparison with
decisional-ambidexterity model which blends the conditioning between
exploration and exploitation. It allows overcoming biases induced by
organization ambidexterity and its limitations such as neglect of
organization design fixations revealed by exploration project
management.</p>

further with decision-design perspective. Organization design and
regenerating capabilities were included as knowledge elements required
