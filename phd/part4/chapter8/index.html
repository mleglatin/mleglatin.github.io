<p><em>Laws should only provide a basis for self-fulfilment.</em>
<strong>Paul Klee</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this first modelling chapter, in the same fashion as described in the
beginning of our literature review, we propose to come back to a
canonical model that requires to be enhanced by generative processes.
James March in his seminal paper had consciously declared the boundaries
of his model (March 
<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>); yet these very same edges
are heavily challenged by the evolutions of innovation management which
have gone beyond the perimeters of the ambidexterity models relying on
the non-mutual conditioning between exploration/exploitation. Generative
processes such as design practices taking place for radical innovation,
ripple throughout decision-making, collective action, coordination
mechanisms and organizations.</p>
<p>Based on the management anomaly specifications and the mirroring
requirements needed to design a new model, we propose to synthesize the
article published in the European Management Review (Le Masson et al.

<a href="#ref-LeMasson2018">2018</a>) (see 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/pub-lemasson2018/">publication</a>). The developed model allows clarifying the heuristics associated
with <strong>decisional ambidexterity</strong> (Le Glatin, Le Masson, and Weil

<a href="#ref-LeGlatin2017a">2017</a>) (see 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/pub-leglatin2017a/">publication</a>). Furthermore, it gives some grounds on the designing of decisions and to set a new frame for collective action.</p>
<p>We discuss which extensions are made on the traditional assumptions on
problem-solving and rational theory of choice thanks to the teachings in
design theory. We can then revisit some stimulating constructs
previously identified in our literature review discussing the
performance of the decision design relating to the <em>innovation potential
of attraction</em> and underlying useful methods and heuristics.</p>
<p>All along the modelling effort in the following section, we make several
references to the previous detected anomalies. We do so in order to
explain how the new model allows gaining new insights. We also refer to
the gap-filling between former models and the new as we also tasked
ourselves to keep coherence and a sense of continuity when coming from
the known to the unknown.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">

    <p>We start by coming back to the original model of (March
<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>) with its foundations in problem-solving and
choice of alternatives. We extend the canonical framework of
decision-making into the unknown with the support of C-K design theory.</p>
<p>Then, we discuss the performance of the decisions designed and made. It
invites to think beyond traditional expected utility theories of choice.</p>

<h2 id="designing-decisions-decisional-ambidexterity-for-organizational-metabolism">Designing decisions: decisional ambidexterity for organizational metabolism</h2>
<p>In the introduction and premises of our literature review (see 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part1/chapter1/">chapter 1</a>, we presented the trajectory of the agent-based model of James
March, creating the construct of exploration and exploitation to sustain
organization learning and fighting for supremacy (March

<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>). The starting point being problem-based - and
consequently decision-making by adding a pinch of uncertainty - allows
considering the bounded rationality of agents limited in their daily
routines, and requiring exploration, i.e. search-based patterns looking
out for overlooked alternatives already present in their decision
space.</p>
<p>The issue of the decision creation is rather left aside by only
promoting the garbage-can decision model and foolishness as a means to
improve the generation of novelty, beyond pure selection issues. Without
discarding altogether a potential contribution from foolishness and
irrationality, starting from the canonical model of decision theory such
as (Wald 
<a href="#ref-Wald1945a">1945</a>, 
<a href="#ref-Wald1949">1949</a>)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> where an
agent picks up an alternative among those offered to her, consequences
$X$ are known depending on the outcome of the states of nature $\Theta$.</p>
<p>The (statistical) decisions ($d:s\in \Theta \rightarrow x\in X$,
$d\in D$) are calculated based on costs of consequences
($c:x\in X \rightarrow y\in\mathbb{R}^+$) and the states of nature
weighted by degrees of probability $\mu$. The theory predicts the
existence of an optimal choice minimizing costs.</p>
<p>Using design theory, such as C-K theory (Hatchuel and Weil

<a href="#ref-Hatchuel2009">2009</a>), for its generality can be used onto the
canonical model $(D,\Theta,c,\mu)$ which can be complemented by
statistical learning $L$ drawn from previous experiences and sampling
$(D,\Theta,c,\mu,L)$. We also address the issue of simultaneous problem
formulation and solving, conceptualized in need-solution pairs (Hippel
and Krogh 
<a href="#ref-VonHippel2016">2016</a>) who encouraged the use of design
theory to identify and generate these pairs.</p>
<h3 id="mobilizing-design-theory-for-decision-paradigm">Mobilizing design theory for decision paradigm</h3>
<p>The dominant design stemming from the decision problem is the optimum
choice in the acknowledged set of choices, beliefs, states of nature and
cost function. Using C-K theory gives a starting point formulated by a
model of knowledge that can be considered as the state of the art, and
the decision broken down into the given environment $\Theta$ and optimal
decision maximising expected utility $d_{MEU}$ (minimizing costs). We
then have a first branch on the concept space, and a first knowledge
sub-space.</p>
<p>Naturally, the Wald’s model gives it own parameters that can be hacked
by design. The set of decisions $D$ and the states of nature $\Theta$
can be then re-designed. Generativity, like in the experiment where
pigeons generate new action to solve a problem (Epstein et al.

<a href="#ref-Epstein1984">1984</a>; Epstein 
<a href="#ref-Epstein1990">1990</a>), will play
on the generation of new decisions, as well as altering the states of
nature. It differs from trial and error in the way that it deals with
novelty, ill-defined problems, by matching stimuli and actual
transformation of the behaviour required to deal with (generated) new
situation.</p>
<p>In a very simple way, we are interested in managing the operators
$D \rightarrow D^{* } $, which generates and reconfigures decisions, and
$\Theta \rightarrow \Theta^*$ which integrates new states of nature,</p>
<p>changes the world’s description, semantics and changes the posture of
the decision-maker with respect to these states. The cost function $c$,
and beliefs $\mu$ will subsequently have to be redefined or simply
extended to the new range.</p>
<p>Coming back to the figure show in the literature review (p.), copied
below, we push the model beyond the Pareto front. As the operators
generate new possibilities, revisiting performance criteria which are
the tip of the iceberg of the transformations of $D$ and $\Theta$.</p>

<h3 id="new-decision-categories">New decision categories</h3>
<p>Firstly, beyond the optimum decision $d_{MEU}$, the decision-designer
can try to push the optimization even further for a given chosen state
of nature $\theta_i \in \Theta$. We have then a **new wishful decision by optimization** ($d_{opt}$). It could be a simple functional improvement added for one feature that could be constrained otherwise by the realization of one outcome in the spectrum of consequences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Optimizing makes the assumption that a lot of parameters have been
identified and locked, so that gap to be explore between what is
boundedly known and what is yet to be known is clear. It could be
considered as the simplest and predictive form of transitioning between
exploration and exploitation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, the uncertainty associated to the considered states of nature
$\Theta$, the decision-designer can study the envelop of available
alternatives $D$ so that he can add a new decision which minimizes costs
for all contingencies: <strong>new wishful decision by genericity</strong> ($d^{gen}$).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Business Class seat, we can label some of their decisions aiming
at developing a platform for a modular product line. The exploration of
existing possibilities (benchmark) and the generation of new
alternatives both encompass a new wishful decision by genericity.</p>
<p>We can also argue that when the client program selected the explored
product design, the exploitation regime performs a regression towards
optimizing as if the preliminary platform design would be robust enough
for a full development and uncertainty reduction. Some knowledge areas
had indeed not been fully uncovered. So, in a <em>post mortem</em> analysis, we
have a better understanding of what could have been managed differently
to maintain the exploration and exploitation effort and their mutual
conditioning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now switching to the design heuristics, instead of leaving $\Theta$
fixated, we can work on redesigning the states of nature.
Thirdly, we can try to change a single state of nature in order to force
the redesign of decisions. Considering an unknown (i.e. out of the
domain) state of nature that may have a devastating impact on
consequences can be one way. Or one could simply just slightly shift a
not very likely state of nature. The idea of the <em>What If?</em> scenario in
Design Thinking methodology addresses this perspective. However, one can
also target the most certain knowledge which hides fixation effects; it
tackles the <em>sure thing principle</em> (Savage 
<a href="#ref-Savage1954">1954</a>, 21).</p>
<p>Following the same fashion, deliberately reversing preferences can force
the design or the concern for an unknown state of nature which may
favour the reversal; as discussed in our paper (Le Glatin, Le Masson,
and Weil 
<a href="#ref-LeGlatin2017a">2017</a>), also in 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/pub-leglatin2017a/">publication</a>.</p>
<p>We are then designing a <strong>new wishful decision by best choice hacking</strong>
($d^{alt}$). For example, if the decision problem was to choose between
known several technologies and associated performance, one could try
reversing the order and try to design a situation where it would work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Icing Conditions Detection case can be interpreted in that way since
considering an unknown safety regulation evolution was to be shaped by
the R&amp;T manager to justify the new performance of the technology in the
new spectrum.</p>
<p>Exploration effectively relies on exploitation constraints to generate
new alternatives. It could be also considered as coming <em>out of the
blue</em>, in a serendipitous way, as an externality or as need-solution
pair (Hippel and Krogh 
<a href="#ref-VonHippel2016">2016</a>). But at least, the
model allows linking them back to the dominant designed decision, since
we can play on the decision space and states of nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, we can reproduce systematically all pieces of certain
knowledge. By doing so, we explore the full extent of fixation effects
considered on knowledge usually requested or made implicit in
decision-making. So we end up with a <strong>new wishful decision by all
choices hacking</strong> ($d^{*}$).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Design Thinking cases, shifting the concepts in aircraft areas,
where BUs are not dealing with the design brief, falls into the category
of all choices hacking. Clearly, it highlights that the exploration has
gone out of the boundaries of what classical search-based model would
have delivered. Such hacking insists on the fact that exploitation won’t
be conducted nor balanced by ignoring the new created interplay.
Frontier between product designs can be totally re-discussed to shape
the new environment (e.g. lower deck, integration between equipment in
galley area, passengers loading their luggage, etc.).</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    Overall, the different decision categories one can design, offers a new
mapping for the decision-maker to envision the course of action. By
becoming a decision-designer, the design reasoning on alternatives
allows, not only understanding the consequences of avoiding the
conditioning between exploration and exploitation, but also to envision
the efforts required in terms of knowledge management. Consequently, it
enables starting to reconciliate the risks of floating of exploration
project management with the organizational learning originally hoped
with (March <a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>) model.
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="knowledge-value">Knowledge value</h3>
<p>The different decisions categories, by simply relying on Wald’s
canonical decision model, show the extension $D$ and $\Theta$ spaces.
The transformation operated by design theory comes with consequences on
the value $c$, beliefs $\mu$ and learning $L$. These are redefined by
composition of $D \rightarrow D^{* }$ and/or
$\Theta \rightarrow \Theta^{* }$.</p>
<p>The most stimulating feature from a standard statistical probability
view is that adding a new decision, or new state of nature, flattens
existing probability distributions. In other words, we <strong>increase global
uncertainty</strong>. And we do it so that it is even more accentuated that it
could perturb a search-based model since we are extending the spaces we
are relying on. From a rational choice theory, it is, of course,
unacceptable but the operators in between the old and the new spaces
take in the possibility of design, it is not an externality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Icing Conditions Detection project, when they reversed their
preferences for a highly uncertain technology, they opened a new
environment to be shaped. The potential risk was reallocated, raising
uncertainties but also made former alternatives less interesting despite
being more certain in a different setting.</p>
<p>Learning can be organized for such purpose. Seen from the development
engineering department, the prototype tested on aircraft is not to be
considered as a traditional exploitation. Instead, it should be seen as
an <em>exploitation exploration</em> where the unfinished engineering work
offers the opportunity to acknowledge and reconfigure engineering rules
around the new technology and system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We consequently endogenize the unknown by design. Not only are we are
building up awareness but also we are anticipating it by systematically
designing and prospectively managing unknown decisions and states of
nature. We are in line with the idea of bringing vigilance (Oury and
Schmidt 
<a href="#ref-Oury1983">1983</a>), opportunism (Lumineau and Verbeke

<a href="#ref-Lumineau2016">2016</a>), reliability (Sutcliffe and Christianson

<a href="#ref-Sutcliffe2012">2012</a>) to the front seat, by turning the
decision-maker into a decision-designer. The underlying assumptions have
been weakened to leave room for design theory to unveil its potential on
its sister theory.</p>
<p>The concept of <em>phronesis</em> (Nonaka, Hirose, and Takeda

<a href="#ref-Nonaka2016">2016</a>), which we discussed in the literature review,
could be then further substantiated with the way a manager makes and
design decisions. It is a means of organizing collective action:
creating simple coordination mechanisms around certain knowledge that
can tweaked collectively by stakeholders, mobilizing (silent) designers
around problems that can be systematically ill-defined by themselves,
and simply overseeing the course of action with other reference points
given by the decisional mapping.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the BC class seat platform project, the early stages of concept
selection and generation with BU stakeholders were an actual case of
blending the exploration with the exploitation constraints. However,
this effort was biased when the project was transferred to program
management as if fit for development. Instead, it could have been the
occasion to continue exploitation knowing and managing learning for a
continuing and parallel exploration. This awareness is however only
realized in the aftermath and not along the transition nor the
exploitation project management.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    This decisional ambidexterity consequently also gives an <strong>extended risk
assessment</strong> register, richer than traditional practices seen in project
management. But, in the same fashion we did, we could manipulate the
risk register which is used, transferred and adapted in between projects
as a representation of the dominant decision design framing (a priori)
collective action in project’s trajectory. The modelled technology of
ambidexterity can give room to the stretching caused by encapsulated
generative processes and still letting them be managed.
  </div>
</div>
<hr>
<h2 id="performance-of-decision-design">Performance of decision design</h2>
<p>The described approach of simply applying a generativity theory to a
foundational canonical model puts the emphasis on the transformation
operators rather than on the dichotomy of exploration and exploitation
regimes. These operators offer a systematic way of exploring given
exploitation references. The dichotomy and non-mutual conditioning are
left aside by a constant articulation of interdependencies of
exploration and exploitation. So, it is not the set of elements and
their nature that counts, but rather the relationship engaged between
them that is to be managed. In that regard, we move beyond duality of
the regimes (Farjoun 
<a href="#ref-Farjoun2010">2010</a>).</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    The performance of both exploration and exploitation will be dependent
on the quality of the generative operators. It implies the collective
effort of designing the fit of decisions, and identifying, acknowledging
and managing fixations effects and underlying interdependencies. It is
crucial to <em>measure</em> and characterize the distance between what
exploitation can achieve on its own path and the different explored and
designed decisions can otherwise. Learning and adaptation take a
different twist with the cognitive fit and design fixation effects.
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="beyond-the-fit-moving-and-designing-target">Beyond the fit: moving and designing target</h3>
<p>The paradoxes of opposing two competing objectives becomes rather
secondary or even transparent, by adopting the design and elucidation of
interdependencies between decisions and states of nature. All the ties
justifying exploration can be derived from exploitation, and conversely
the exploitation can be justified by a reference enlarged by
exploitation.</p>
<p>The constant generative search is rooted in exploitation, and
exploitation is inversely valued through exploration. The pattern is
similar to the novelty-search algorithm (Nguyen, Yosinski, and Clune

<a href="#ref-Nguyen2015">2015</a>; Cully et al. 
<a href="#ref-Cully2015">2015</a>) designed
for robots to improve their resilience, but we improve such heuristics
by considering that the problem is also re-formulated, as if the
underlying algebra was reconfigured.</p>
<p>For instance, not only has the robot a performance objective (reaching a
given point in space), the novelty-search algorithm will generate new
movements in two dimensions without knowing the terrain. But, it will
only operate with the possible actuators available and their performance
range. It is also crucial to reconsider the actuators framing the range
and nature of alternatives. This is what we achieve with our
operators.</p>
<p>Conditioning exploration by exploitation, can be considered actually
quite natural but let us remember that numerous design and creativity
methods encourage to liberate constraints and be careful with brief
formulation. <em>Thinking out of the box</em> also requires starting by
defining the box itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the icing conditions detection project, opposing the technology
alternatives imposes to value them against a given system, integration
and regulations. Reversing the preferences, encourages to reconfigure
the value framework: new system, new integration constraints and new
regulations. The problem reformulation is built upon an exploitation
constraint and target on the move. Consequently, a fraction of the
project management is driven towards ensuring the target is managed to
satisfy preferences reversal.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="overcoming-biases-and-fixation-effects">Overcoming biases and fixation effects</h3>
<p>The performance of exploration will be seen through the generativity of
the design practices. These will be valued relatively to reference
points which can be previously generated decisions or potential
decisions. But as the end game is to be able to decide and organize
collective action for these, it would be even more practical to set the
reference on exploration points.</p>
<p>We have discussed exploitation and <em>weak</em> exploration natural
reliability, path dependency, can not only be biased due to bounded
rationality but also can be fixated due to lack of understanding of
environment awareness, system thinking and organizational design.</p>
<p>Newly generated concepts may be indeed challenging epistemic
interdependencies which will have to be carefully managed when these are
revealed by directly concerned decision-makers. It is then preferable to
have them actively dealing with the (re)-design practice of these
interdependencies and their rationality that was contextually
established and fixated.</p>
<p>As James March partly addressed it (see quotation below (March

<a href="#ref-March2006">2006</a>, 209)), he gave a few hints on how the produce of
exploration, be it foolish or not, would eventually become rational and
exploited could be used as a basis for exploration. We believe that our
model allows elucidating this mutual conditioning and how to exploit it
for exploration and vice-versa. This complement to the separation
between exploration and exploitation had been omitted in the original
model (March 
<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>) as noted in our literature review.
It underlines the natural interaction between what makes exploration and
exploitation. However, it doesn’t imply necessarily a continuum nor
orthogonality, but rather multiple relationships to be surfaced and
managed.</p>
<p><em>It is argued that the link between rationality and conventional
knowledge keeps rational technologies reliable but inhibits creative
imagination. This characterization seems plausible, but it probably
underestimates the potential contribution of rational technologies to
foolishness and radical visions.</em></p>
<p>In the Design Thinking cases, an external observer, unfamiliar with the
history of aircraft cabin equipment and stringent standards &amp;
regulations, could easily consider product designs, interfaces and usage
totally foolish. Different value networks taken from other user
experience (passenger, cabin crew) will confront to rationally developed
products and services.</p>
<p>Anchoring the exploration to exploitation provides a playground to
relieve constraints faced by dominant designs, promoting new
interactions with users, or even hacking altogether how things are done
and envision a new environment (e.g. lower deck, passenger boarding).
However, the learning associated with the defixation is to be further
explained as it unlocks several interdependencies that are not
self-evident when just showcasing concepts or prototypes.</p>
<p>The performance is discussed in different ways and through action
engaged in the decision-design process. Adaption model is left close
enough to optimizing decision and richer exploration can be achieved by
challenging beliefs, preferences order and states of nature.
Interactions can be managed around these parameters. And the
encapsulation can be tracked and positioned with respect to learning
challenges.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>Finally, not only the distance is generated away from a dominant design,
fixation points and ingrained interdependencies, but it is also key to
enable the constant transformational dialog between these two.</p>
<p>Performance of decision design is then substantiated through the
heuristics presented earlier and the necessity of interacting through
them. It will target multiple parameters in engineering design and
constraints.</p>

<p>Below, the figure
<a href="#fig:modelADM" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:modelADM">2</a>
represents, with C-K formalism, the different designed decision
categories and the knowledge used. We specify the different <strong>wishful
decisions</strong> and the enabling knowledge hacked to design new decisions
and new states of nature.
Following customs in C-K theory, the dominant design is left on the left
of the concept tree where we have put the wishful decision by
optimization ($d_{opt}$). A variation to the optimization can be then to
design by considering a wishful decision by genericity ($d^{gen}$). It
considers as many states of nature possible by defining an envelop of
consequences that the decision should be ready to address. Then, hacking
the states of nature, opens a new branch with two new designed decisions
categories: wishful decision by best choice hacking and all choices
hacking. The first tackles what could be the dominant, what is more
obvious, the sure thing principle. The second shifts the decision
problem in a new environment.</p>

brings the comparison between the newly designed model of mutual
conditioning of exploration/exploitation and the former derived from the
literature. Several items have to be further specified given the chosen
descriptors used for the anomaly detection. We have discussed the
fixation effects and necessary anchoring to exploitation parameters
facilitating the management of exploration. The mutual conditioning
between exploration and exploitation will channel learning, dealing with
interdependencies. Therefore, it will also require looking beyond the
cognitive dimension of decision-designing. Organization design, the
mirroring dynamic as well as action modes organizing <em>decisional
ambidexterity</em> will have to be taken into account to fully cover the
anomalies identified with all descriptors.
These incomplete model features presented in the following table will be
discussed in the [following chapter]

The organizational metabolism can then be discussed in more detail to
sustain organizational change and learning.</p>

    <p>We have used the requirements listed in the previous chapter after
detecting and specifying the anomalies in several cases. We have then
proposed to start anew by coming back to the beginning of our literature
review.</p>
<p>The canonical model of decision theory (Wald <a href="#ref-Wald1949">1949</a>,
<a href="#ref-Wald1945a">1945</a>) is mobilized to consider the problems-solving
with uncertainty described in the seminal paper (March
<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>). As we had repeatedly tested the edges of the
literature models of non-mutual conditioning between exploration and
exploitation, we have used the teachings of design theory to extend
decision theory into the unknown.</p>
<p>It allowed specifying different decision categories and heuristics
playing with decision problem parameters and formulation. The model
proposed an <strong>extended risk management</strong> as the uncertainty is increased
by design but at the same time uses exploitation core specified by
fixation effects, biases of bounded rationality and interdependencies to
ground exploration and manage its generativity and value.</p>
<p>We have also made reference to the previous anomalies and made sense of
them with the help of the decision ambidexterity. They fall into several
designed decision categories in the unknown and they let clarifying what
has been missed or what was in the blind spot of models of
ambidexterity.</p>
<p>The following chapter complements the gaps left in the model’s
description as we had specified several organizational descriptors to
detect the anomalies. We will define further decisional ambidexterity
with our concern for strategic management and organizational learning
and change.</p>
