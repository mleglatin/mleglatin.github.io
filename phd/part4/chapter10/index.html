<p><em>Everyone who designs devises a course of action aimed at changing
existing situations into preferred ones.</em>
<strong>Herbert A. Simon</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have established a new model to reconcile the original construct of
ambidexterity with the evolutions innovation management. By revisiting
the canonical model of decision-making with design theory, decisional
ambidexterity allows us to endogenize the unknown within a technology of
organizing collective action to metabolize innovation across the firm.
The performance is supported by the interactions between
decision-designers revealing interdependencies and their
reconfiguration. The value management unfolds as the project trajectory
may be manoeuvred away from technical, organizational and environmental
fixations. Exploitation dimensions are used to sustain a generative and
grounded exploration.</p>
<p>The model was first built on a simple agent-based foundation, and since
we tasked ourselves several requirements defined in contrast with
anomalies, we made use of the mirroring hypothesis to discuss the
necessary organizational change. This transformational process we
propose to link with organizational metabolism, is an embodiment of the
recombination of routines or regenerative dynamic capabilities.</p>
<p>Therefore, it reflects the generative learning expected by (temporary)
project-based organization and its boundaries with permanent
organization. Otherwise, project will float across the organization.
Consequently, we propose to test our model of mutual conditioning
between exploration and exploitation. To do so, we use two case studies
conducted at Zodiac Aerospace. We extend the preliminary testing and
understanding gained in the two previous chapter when defining our
model. The anomalies became understandable as the model of decisional
ambidexterity gives a larger framework to make sense of decisions and
concepts that are otherwise labelled as absurd or irrational.</p>
<p>The first project stems from the Design Case studies hosted by ADT we
have analysed in the anomaly detection chapter. As explained, in the

<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#lower-deck">case presentation</a>, the project was launched after ADT manager
decided to further conceptualize the recurrent idea of using aircraft’s
lower deck. It was also notified by the researcher in 2016 when
presenting his first analysis of the design thinking cases.</p>
<p>The second project originates from two members of the ZSTC with a
history of entrepreneurship and innovation. They had reasons to launch a
project on aircraft connectivity given their experience on
telecommunications, satellites, antennae and onboard computers. It was
set as a proper MBU project justifying its value proposal to the ExCom
(see 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#connected-cabin">case presentation</a>).
Both cases are comparable in the sense they were sponsored by the ExCom,
offered budget and internal/external network support to find answers,
contour their ill-defined problems and test the concepts (on slides,
digital mock-ups and physical proof of concepts). We use the same
analytical lens and descriptors introduced in our methodological
chapters enhanced with the logics of decisional ambidexterity (decision
categories, learning, organization design). Comparing these two cases
will allow testing further our model by gaining an understanding that is
missed with models of non-mutual conditioning between exploration and
exploitation.</p>
<p>In the first section, we present the Lower Deck project, its trajectory
and present the several patterns phased with decisional ambidexterity.
In the second section, we discuss the Connected Cabin project, which,
despite benefitting from an equivalent context and support, fails to
sustain a decisional ambidexterity. The project unfortunately regresses
towards biases of traditional models of ambidexterity, hence killing its
innovation potential of attraction. These two case studies give us a
richer understanding of what decisional ambidexterity can achieve in
reconciliating logics of exploration project management with a renewed
organizational learning and adaptation rooted in generative logics.</p>

<h2 id="lower-deck-from-design-feature-to-value-space">Lower Deck: from design feature to value space</h2>
<h3 id="trajectory-of-the-project">Trajectory of the project</h3>
<p>As presented in our case presentation (see 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#lower-deck">section</a>), the project of Lower
Deck started due to the accumulation of concepts generated in several
projects over two years at ADT. Among them, many had the recurrent idea
of using the aircraft’s lower deck. A first provisional patent
application process was started mid-2014 (see patent no.
US20170233058A1). Late 2015, the patent was made public and made quite
an impact with numerous critics coming from specialized blogs, magazines
and newspapers<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The Design Thinking case studies started in 2015 and
what continued over 2016 also made use of the lower deck in various
ways.</p>
<p>The researcher had identified the pivotal role of this a priori
underused aircraft area to enable concepts that cross over BU
boundaries. In parallel, ZA’s CEO, during an interview conducted in May
2018 by the PhD candidate, told the concept had already been discussed
during ExCom meetings previous to the project formalization. The case
seemed justified to them as they had insights on the declining freight
market: an increasing empty space in the lower deck was then available.
Finally, a project was kicked off and took the concept on its own
mid-2016 and directly managed by ADT manager.</p>
<p>Several dimensions were addressed simultaneously. Firstly, an underlying
mechanical stress study was conducted: the CTO contracted an engineering
consultancy firm to evaluate the technical and safety feasibility of
using the lower deck for passengers seating and other airline ancillary
revenues. Secondly, the support of group business development directors
in charge of airlines accounts offered a way to engage talks with key
airline representatives (<em>interpreters</em> (Verganti and Dell’Era

<a href="#ref-Verganti2014">2014</a>)). It was the occasion to probe airlines
interest and gradually contour client value. Thirdly, later 2016/early
2017, the VP of Strategy (ADT manager’s director) contracted another
consultancy firm to dig into the ticket pricing model (yield management)
and airlines operation cycles in order to economically value lower
deck’s use cases but also find time frames when the aircraft lower deck
could be modified without disrupting aircraft’s operations. Finally, a
last study was contracted internally with two business units familiar
with tailored aircraft modification (VIP, movies, medical care, etc.)
for a preliminary design and engineering specification to adapt the
lower deck for the different use cases. Early 2018, a new patent
application was made with more critical claims specifying the value of
the concept refined over time (see patent no. WO2018037268A9). And the
global concept was finally revealed to the public with Airbus as a
sponsor and co-designer during Aircraft Interior Exposition in April
2018. A partnership agreement was signed between Airbus and Zodiac
Aerospace to develop the product.</p>
<p>What is rather surprising in this project trajectory is the fact that
the lower deck feature was first used in several concepts and
systematically discarded by BUs who participated to previous projects
(including those supported by Design Thinking practice). Concepts were
discarded despite having justified user and client value, and having
raised some technical difficulties through complimentary meetings with
engineers and designers. However, once the lower deck was turned into a
proper value space looking for use cases, it gained much more momentum,
specially from business unit managers. They indeed requested to host the
project in their branch of activity.
The figure
<a href="#fig:LWDTraj" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:LWDTraj">1</a>
below gives a synthetic view of the project trajectory including the
previous Design Thinking cases. Given the decisional ambidexterity model
we can specify the nature of decisions designed.</p>
<h4 id="problem-inversion-of-design-thinking-cases">Problem inversion of Design Thinking cases</h4>
<p>Firstly, we can see that some decisions started from an enhanced
optimization, moved towards hacking several choices extending concepts
in between or outside BUs boundaries. Some of these were triggered by
user input and <em>What If?</em> scenarios. The Lower Deck feature was one of
them ($d^*$). However, once the concepts are selected, ranked, sponsored
and promoted to BUs, the generative effort is reduced to an
optimization: finding the best fit for BUs without changing engineering
capabilities, or at best marginally by incrementally modifying existing
products (new requirement). The issue is also that this optimization and
biased adaptation is mirrored by underlying interdependencies and
fixations.</p>
<p>For instance, using a waste chute and sorting mechanisms in the lower
deck could be developed by Zodiac Inserts who developed the trash
compactor (a trolley locked into the galley area). The latter
corresponds to a given certification and qualification process. Zodiac
Galley could also have considered the product development given its
specialty on panels and fixtures withstanding stress and loads, as well
as water and electrical circuitry integration (also another
certification/qualification process). Finally Zodiac Cargo, who develops
containers would be appropriate to develop the relevant container lodged
in the lower deck providing the sorting and extraction of waste. It is a
potential multi-BU project which always calls for another requirement
partly mastered by another BU. It could be developed by each BU
individually as technologies are similar or at reach. The incentive to
work together would only come if they had a real client demand and/or a
change in certification and qualification. Moreover, the concept
requires reconsidering airline operations and purchasing policy, so
training and change of practice is required in the sales pitch.</p>
<p>Secondly, the induced organizational and environmental phenomena were
not really addressed in the Lower Deck project premises. The problem was
turned inside out to make the choice hacking more visible. So, instead
of forcing the BU congruence, it gave a whole new flavour to the
innovation potential of attraction as described in Table
<a href="#table:LWDtab" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="table:LWDtab">[table:LWDtab]</a>
below. Meetings held with the ExCom insisted heavily on the technical
advantage that should be designed, since they were rather confident on
the client value and market attractivity. The discussions were oriented
to ensure the development of a turnkey solution as well as competitive
advantage against the footprint of aircraft manufacturers. In other
words, they shifted the concept towards having an empty shell. The value
space guaranteed its technical feasibility, with the prospect of a
separate qualification and certification process. Consequently, BUs
could articulate their products in this new space, without worrying
about their engineering and organization design fixations, and focus on
regenerating their products for this new value space.</p>
<h4 id="regenerative-capability-through-design-formulation">Regenerative capability through design formulation</h4>
<p>The Lower Deck became rather modular and generic for several BUs who
needed to develop new design capability to fit requirements evolution.
It encouraged the adaptation to the newly designed environment. Instead
of forcing the fit to each specific BUs, the problem inversion, allowed
attracting them to provide use cases.</p>
<p>Decisional ambidexterity reveals the importance of project management
and corporate entrepreneurship interactions steering the project
trajectory where the novel value is not forced onto an a priori
independent BU, but rather on formulating a concept design that attracts
them to grow. It moves them away from their fixations by creating
<em>generative fit</em> (Avital and Te’eni 
<a href="#ref-Avital2009">2009</a>), thus
supporting the regenerative capability expected from them. The
organization design was not clearly discussed during project meetings,
but the decisional ambidexterity allows us to formulate the idea that
product engineering embedded how interdependencies could be unlocked.
Otherwise, a non-mutual conditioning would focus only on numerous other
explanations: leader as champion, acculturation to the lower deck
prospect. Perhaps yes, but it does not make it manageable and does not
give much directions to guide collective action and engineering design
practice.</p>

<h2 id="connected-cabin-project-mode-and-proof-of-concept">Connected Cabin: project mode and proof of concept?</h2>
<h3 id="trajectory-of-the-project-1">Trajectory of the project</h3>
<p>The project was initiated by two members of the ZSTC (see 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#connected-cabin">case presentation</a>) who started testing the idea of addressing the trending topic of Big
Data and Aircraft Connectivity. The topic had already triggered the
development of in-flight connectivity with satellite antennae and ground
antennae, including the ongoing product development by Zodiac Data
Systems specialized in providing tele-measurement devices for testing
and monitoring. In September 2016, the first summit dedicated to
aircraft connectivity, <em>Smart Plane</em>, was hosted in parallel as a
chapter of the major <em>World Satellite Business Week</em> in Paris. The
topics were gradually gaining importance in the industrial ecosystem.
However, already in late 2015, during a ZSTC meeting, the two members
pitched the idea on how Zodiac Aerospace, as a group, could set a foot
on this emergent market.</p>
<p>As pictured in figure
<a href="#fig:IconnzTraj" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:IconnzTraj">2</a>
below, they originally presented the idea of creating connectivity
platform providing value-added service for predictive maintenance and
airline operations. The claim was grounded on the fact that Zodiac
Aerospace was a legitimate player to provide such integrated solution as
the group covers the full extent of the cabin and several other key
equipment in the aircraft systems. Their knowledge on tele-transmission
with the products developed within Zodiac Inflight Innovations (fast
growing player in the inflight entertainment market) allowed them to
consider connectivity solutions between equipment so far isolated and
managed by independent systems. The concept would thus overcome
rigidities for airline operations and consequently passenger
discontent.</p>
<p>Several meetings were held with the ExCom in order to have full support
of top management so that middle management would allocate resources in
order to demonstrate the value proposal and business case of such
project. The discussions were complex and frustrating as the board of
directors was asking for what would make Zodiac Aerospace legitimate
beyond market footprint. They were asking for a technology
differentiator, something that would ensure the market niche<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. For
instance, the CEO would have preferred to have Zodiac Data Systems to
develop a technology (antenna, computer, etc.). In the end, the board
was gradually convinced that the key was to be able to manage an
ecosystem of industrial players rather than the hardware by making a
direct comparison to Apple iPhone’s development. They allocated budget
to the project so that BUs could allocate time to their engineers and
managers. The former CEO also communicated to investors on the project’s
kick-off.</p>
<p>Soon after late 2016, a whole project team was tasked by the ExCom to
build a demonstrator for the following Aircraft Interior Exposition
(AIX, April 2017). The design effort was driven towards making a
<em>Minimum Viable Product</em>: a scenario was drawn with several pieces of
equipment showing the benefits of cabin connectivity for airline
operations and passenger experience. The proof of concept embodied in a
full scale mock-up was modelled to show integration capabilities and
synergies. Numerous workshops were held in different location to stage
gate the project and track the progress of sub-projects around the
connectivity backbone.</p>
<p>During an internal show with airlines organized by of one the major
cabin BU in California, they had the occasion to probe some potential
clients to provide feedback to the ongoing demonstrator design. It was
also used to narrow down the questionnaire used during AIX. The
exposition was a success, leading airlines executives came to visit and
experience the product along with ZA’s top management. Several critical
comments came regarding known preoccupations in the market: data
ownership, intellectual property, compatibility and standardization
among industrial players.</p>
<p>What is quite impressive is AIX aftermath. Every BUs complimented each
other, went back to their businesses. And several emails exchanged
between project’s members, including R&amp;T, Marketing and Engineering
managers of respective BUs, revealed how perplex they were on the
project’s termination. They wouldn’t understand why the ExCom and other
BUs wouldn’t continue with the project. Several other factors can be
taken into account: e.g. change of priorities for ExCom concerned with
Safran’s acquisition (but it didn’t slow nor stop the lower deck
project), and European funded projects on small connectivity technology
block at BU-level but reduced scope.</p>
<h4 id="regression-to-the-mean">Regression to the mean</h4>
<p>By contrast with the lower deck project, and given the similar context,
the project’s gained momentum raises the question of how efficient the
project’s output was. Of course, pure continuity of the project cannot
be always requested, but the takeaways are scarce. The major one still
keeping a system thinking on the value chain can be seen for Zodiac
Catering Equipment, but they already had an agenda on passenger
experience, cabin crew and airline/caterer operations before the
project.</p>
<p>The figure
<a href="#fig:IconnzTraj" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:IconnzTraj">2</a>
shows how the genericity and platform concept was originally pushed
forward in a newly managed environment. Decisional ambidexterity quickly
reveals that there was some regression to the mean (Kahneman

<a href="#ref-Kahneman2011">2011</a>) or concept shifting towards a reference point
(Heath, Larrick, and Wu 
<a href="#ref-Heath1999">1999</a>). This drift is
unfortunately stuck due to organization fixation and interdependencies
relatively to their product engineering and market segmentation.</p>
<h4 id="proof-of-concept-to-trigger-a-full-scale-multi-bu-project">Proof of concept to trigger a full-scale multi-BU project?</h4>
<p>As we also stress in table
<a href="#table:Iconnztab" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="table:Iconnztab">[table:Iconnztab]</a>,
the organization design was left aside and uncontrolled. So, each
respective BU would work on recombining their engineering routines to
think of the new platform for cabin connectivity. The proof of concept
targeted the added requirement of using a communication bus and protocol
(wired or wireless). The decisional ambidexterity highlights the need
for an organization-design-oriented proof of concept supporting the
original intent and sustaining the regeneration of capabilities among
BU.</p>
<p>At some point, the CTO notified the researcher that the project was in
&ldquo;project mode&rdquo;. This comment clearly criticizes the limitations of
encapsulation and its tendency for not considering enough change
management and organizational learning and design. Decisional
ambidexterity can also be used to discuss the proof of concept activity
embodied by the physical demonstrator, scenario/storytelling, and
associated prototyping activities to embody the scenario/storytelling.</p>
<p>It allows indeed to formalise choice hacking, environment management,
design of states of nature, designing by referring to BU
(organizational) fixation effects. In the Connected Cabin demonstrator
prototype, we can actually extrapolate what else could have been done to
sustain the original concept. For instance, beyond the hardware add-one
for existing products, exploiting the constraints of the connectivity
topic could have been explored: bandwidth allocation and use, protocol,
confidentiality and property. The hardware is of course important, but
it corresponds to a retrofit activity, and it is made possible only
after crossing qualification/certification/acceptation barriers. These
are high-level and system constraints but they can easily shadow
engineering ideas. Decisional ambidexterity proposes to generate and
segregate alternatives to identify such control variables and actions to
realize concepts.</p>

<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>In this model testing chapter, we have presented two comparable cases
steered by the ExCom in the form of multi-BU projects. The mutual
conditioning between exploration and exploitation in our model of
decisional ambidexterity allows understanding the logics of generative
processes and its innovation potential of attraction. They had similar
coordination mechanisms as they were encapsulated into projects but the
actions engaged to make a case for the proof of concept bended the
project trajectory and organizational change in different ways.</p>
<p>The organization metabolism would not be activated given some constraints on
engineering capabilities, standards and regulations as well as market
segmentation. The literature models of non-mutual conditioning would
indeed explain some patterns in the two cases. Consequently, we can
formulate the result that the collective action of decision-designers
requires to be organized on multiple levels with the appropriate
heuristics and technology of organization. The common purpose, or task
formulation, frames also the capabilities of the project, its reach and
potential of attraction across organizations. We then back up the
validity of our model of decisional ambidexterity.</p>
<p>The Lower Deck project had a strong emphasis on securing the concept feasibility and
market access, the virtual mock-ups was rather a means to formalize,
update the concept’s model and communicate. However, in the Connected
Cabin project, the demonstrator became almost an end in itself up to a
point the designed generic decisions where gradually biased by strong
organizational fixations and locked interdependencies. It reduced the
wishful platform engineering to simply adding a function requirement to
each equipment. The one-stop shop for all aircraft equipment
manufacturers was reduced to an isolated add-on feature for existing and
fixated BU-engineered equipment.</p>
<p>The two presented cases had similar management sponsorship, and corporate entrepreneurship spirit. They
reveal the subtleties of decisional ambidexterity and the nature of
generative effort, its management to avoid the limitations of
organizational ambidexterity. The interactions with designed decisions,
designed artefacts and steering committees appears key to manoeuvre the
project’s trajectory but also regenerate capabilities among BUs to
support the project-based management.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part5/">following part</a>,
we will address the contributions made by the researcher. Several
opportunities were seized to test <em>in vivo</em> decisional ambidexterity and
further proof of validation were provided by interactions with peers
within Zodiac Aerospace.</p>
