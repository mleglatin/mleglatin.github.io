abstract = {Purpose ? The purpose of this paper is to review the content and contributions of the article by Klein and Meckling entitled ?Application of operations research to development decisions? which was published in the journal Operations Research in May?June 1958. The paper explores the major concepts and contributions in the article and suggests that these are relevant to today's complex and uncertain development projects.Design/methodology/approach ? The paper outlines the context in which the research on which the article is based took place and presents the main ideas in the article which relate to decision making in the procurement and development of complex systems.Findings ? The paper demonstrates the utility of the concepts in the original article, shows how they have been used in academic research on project management and innovation and that they are still relevant for both practical project management and project?based research.Practical implications ? The primary implication is to demonstrate the value of revisiting a classic contribution in project management, in this case, one which remained hidden for a long period, but has recently come to the fore again.Originality/value ? The issues raised by the original article ? related to decision making under conditions of uncertainty ? remain high on the agenda today and revisiting the article may help provide a better appreciation of how to deal with those issues.},

abstract = {esearch summary:U‐ and inverted U‐shaped relationships are increasingly explored in strategy research, with 11 percent of all articles published in Strategic Management Journal (SMJ) in 2008–2012 investigating such quadratic relationships. Moreover, a movement towards introducing moderation to quadratic relationships has emerged. By reviewing 110 articles published in SMJ from 1980 to 2012, we identify several critical issues in theorizing and testing of these relationships for which current practice falls short. These include insufficient causal argumentation, incorrect testing, mixing up two different types of moderation, and not realizing that the curve can flip completely. For these and other issues, a guideline is provided which, when followed, may bring clarity to theoretical motivation and rigor to empirical testing. Managerial summary:Too much can be as bad as too little. Many relationships in strategic management follow an inverted U‐shaped pattern, where moderate levels of a strategy lead to optimal performance. To gain deeper insights into the conventional wisdom that too much of a good thing can be harmful to performance, we discuss how such relationships can be better theorized and tested based on a review of articles exploring U‐shaped relationships in Strategic Management Journal during 1980–2012. We identify several critical issues that require close attention and provide a guideline to further develop and validate this important managerial intuition},

Although work on project capabilities is a fast-growing line of inquiry, little is still known about how clients assemble project capabilities to achieve operational outcomes in inter-organisational settings. This study seeks to apply theoretical work on project capabilities to the domain of infrastructure project delivery in order to understand how the assembly of project capabilities in temporary inter-organisational settings contributes to the delivery of operational outcomes. The empirical enquiry takes place in the context of the delivery of London Heathrow Terminal 2. Through an inductive theory building approach drawing upon semi-structured interviews with client-side project leadership, internal documents, publicly available data and ongoing engagement with the field, we identified three key capability-enabling mechanisms that help explain the genesis of project capabilities in inter-organisational settings: (1) reconfiguring project capabilities, (2) adapting project capabilities and (3) maintaining project capabilities. We discuss and expand these findings by engaging with theoretical ideas from project studies, and mainstream strategy, organisation, and management research to induce a dynamic model that can be helpful to guide future research, policy and management practices relating to the client side management of project capabilities.},

@article{Hatchuel1986,
abstract = {The last few years have brought a large movement of interrogating issues concerning the role and image of Operations Research. But, as a matter of paradox, the 'OR crisis' gives a better understanding of the role of rational modelling in choice processes and decision making. Rational models are a mean for conceiving idealised behaviour-rational myths-in structured situations; they are not first of all destined to be implemented or applied; they are the reference against which the analyst confronts the observed behaviour of specified actors. This confrontation permits the analyst to build with these actors a new vision of the constraints and objectives in which they operate. The resulting organisational dynamics are the soundest basis for evaluating the efficiency of this process. It is argued that the underlying mechanism of this learning process can be generally specified as a 'tool-structure interaction'. These concepts describe a possible bridge between OR and organizational studies; it may lead to a renewed research in Management Science, avoiding the known pitfalls of these fields, when considerated separately in practice or in training. These points will be illustrated by the help of two cases studies concerning respectively scheduling problems in a job-shop and risky decisions in oil production investments. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {This article draws on historical material to examine the co-evolution of economic science and business education over the course of the twentieth century, showing that fields evolve not only through internal struggles but also through struggles taking place in adjacent fields. More specifically, we argue that the scientific strategies of business schools played an essential—if largely invisible and poorly understood—role in major transformations in the organization and substantive direction of social-scientific knowledge, and specifically economic knowledge, in twentieth century America. We use the Wharton School as an illustration of the earliest trends and dilemmas (ca. 1900–1930), when business schools found themselves caught between their business connections and their striving for moral legitimacy in higher education. Next, we look at the creation of the Carnegie Tech Graduate School of Industrial Administration after World War II. This episode illustrates the increasingly successful claims of social scientists, backed by philanthropic foundations, on business education and the growing appeal of “scientific” approaches to decision-making and management. Finally, we argue that the rise of the Graduate School of Business at the University of Chicago from the 1960s onwards (and its closely related cousin at the University of Rochester) marks the decisive ascendancy of economics, and particularly financial economics, in business education over the other behavioral disciplines. We document the key role of these institutions in diffusing “Chicago-style” economic approaches—offering support for deregulatory policies and popularizing narrowly financial understandings of the firm—that sociologists have described as characteristic of the modern neo liberal regime.},

We conducted an inductive study of feedback meetings in creative projects in two contexts—modern dance and product design—to understand how feedback might influence the development of creative prototypes. Our emergent findings reframe current theorizing on feedback by revealing its interactive nature: feedback providers and creative workers co-construct a problem space that provides openings for changing prototypes. Our analysis revealed sets of moves that feedback providers (personalizing, puzzling, measuring, and pre- scribing) and creative workers (backgrounding, forecasting, and opening) use to interact. We also found evidence that patterns among these moves helped guide one of two responses: (1) excavations, when feedback spurs comprehensive changes by prompting creative workers to return to old ideas, and (2) adjustments, when feedback spurs incremental refinements to the prototype. We integrate these findings into a process model that describes how feedback influences creative projects over time.},

abstract = {Cyert and March's (1963) A Behavioral Theory of the Firm and the broader Carnegie School form critical theoretical underpinnings for modern organization studies. Despite its impact, however, we suggest that researchers who rely on the Carnegie School have progressively lost touch with its defining commitment to a decision-centered view of organizations. Decision making has given way to learning, routines, and an increased focus on change and adaptation; the organizational level of analysis, although frequently invoked, has been largely supplanted by either a more micro or a more macro focus. In this paper, we argue for restoring the School's original mission and perspective. Our proposal for how this overarching goal can be achieved encompasses three central points. First, we believe the School needs to resurrect a few select ideas that, despite their fundamental importance, have been neglected over time. Second, we believe there is a need for greater paradigmatic closure amongst the School's central theoretical pillars. Loose coupling among such pillars might keep key insights on organizational decision making from emerging. Finally, there is the need to incorporate major developments that have been generated post-Carnegie School, both within organization theory and in the behavioral and social sciences more broadly. In particular, we point to the shift to more open systems perspectives on organizations, the conceptions of organizations being embedded in larger social contexts, and recent developments in the study of individual cognition},

Our observations highlight a pragmatic approach to design in which incompleteness is harnessed in a generative manner.

Based on a series of conference papers given at the opening of the Peter B. Lewis Building (designed by Frank Gehry) at the Weatherhead School of Management, Case Western Reserve University, the book includes keynote speeches from Frank Gehry and Karl Weick. The premise of this book is that managers should act not only as decision makers, but also as designers. Though decision and design are inextricably linked in management action, managers and scholars have too long emphasized the decision face of management over the design face. In a series of essays from a multitude of disciplines, the authors develop a theory of the design attitude in contrast to the more traditionally accepted and practiced decision attitude. The book will appeal primarily to scholars of management theory and organization strategy and managers, with many contributions from a variety of academic backgrounds including architecture, sociology, design, history, choreography, strategy, economics, music, and accounting. There is a potential for strong crossover appeal to these groups, especially to those people and groups interested in design and product development.},

The theory of schizophrenia presented here is based on communications analysis, and specifically on the Theory of Logical Types. From this theory and from observations of schizophrenic patients is derived a description, and the necessary conditions for, a situation called the "double bind"--a situation in which no matter what a person does, he "can't win." It is hypothesized that a person caught in the double bind may develop schizophrenic symptoms. How and why the double bind may arise in a family situation is discussed, together with illustrations from clinical and experimental data. This is a report on a research project which has been formulating and testing broad, systematic view of the nature, etiology, and therapy of schizophrenia. Our research in this field has proceeded by discussion of a varied body of data and ideas, with all of us contributing according to our varied experience in anthropology, communications analysis, psychotherapy, psychiatry, and psychoanalysis.

abstract = {The success of many knowledge-intensive industries depends on creative projects that lie at the heart of their logic of production. The temporality of such projects, however, is an issue that is insufficiently understood. To address this, we study the perceived time frame of teams that work on creative projects and its effects on project dynamics. An experi- ment with 267 managers assigned to creative project teams with varying time frames demonstrates that, compared to creative project teams with a relatively longer time frame, project teams with a shorter time frame focus more on the immediate present, are less immersed in their task and utilize a more heuristic mode of information processing. Furthermore, we find that time frame moderates the negative effect of team conflict on team cohesion. These results are consistent with our theory that the temporary nature of creative projects shapes different time frames among project participants, and that it is this time frame that is an important predictor of task and team processes.},

@article{Aubry2018,
abstract = {This paper aims at positioning organizational design as an important phenomenon in the field of project management with a high potential of contributing to organizational theory. While organizational design has been neglected by scholars of management and organizational theory, it has been of great interest to those from the project management field. This incongruence—comprising the focus of this study—calls for new insights on theorization in context. The paper provides a preliminary theoretical framework combining contingency theory, the historical approach and social theory to understand organizational design, both as a thing and as a process. It provides empirical evidence from three case studies in healthcare. Findings confirm the specificity of each design while at the same time adopting a similar temporal pattern. We take this opportunity to highlight the seminal work of Rodney Turner on project-based organization and design. Executive summary In this day and age, it is commonplace to assert that organizations are complex and that they change continuously over time. The complexity is said to exist, for example, in large organizations dealing with multiple competing projects while at the same time performing their regular operations. The concept of organizational design refers to both the resulting organization (the thing) and the process of performing the design. The field of project management has made many theoretical contributions to organizational design; yet it has also created confusion by introducing a plurality of terms for describing and understanding such organizations. Organizational design is increasingly a topic in the literature from management and organizational theory and, especially, from project management. A review of the literature from both fields demonstrates that contingency theory is still considered as a major theoretical foundation for situating the organization within its context. The review also points to an increasing interest in social perspectives taking into account politics, organizational dynamics, paradoxes and pluralism. In addition, it shows an opportunity for scholars in project management to contribute to management and organizational theory. This research proposes a pluralist theoretical framework for tackling contingency theory with the historical approach and social theory. The empirical setting is comprised of complex large organizations—in this case, three university hospitals engaged in major organizational transformations—that are challenged to pursue their regular operations while undertaking multiple completing projects. Interestingly, the three hospitals are from the same geographical region. The organizational design was thus a crucial question and, in light of the complexity, no one-size-fits-all type of solution was strived for. Results confirmed the prevalence of individual organizational design rather than mimetism, or homogenization, between the three hospitals. Being in the same region, the heads of the respective project management offices met on a number of occasions to exchange about their challenges and solutions. Nevertheless, in the end each hospital made an individual decision regarding its organizational design. The study also identified organizational design as an ongoing process, introducing the concept of trajectory to illustrate how projects and organizational design change over time. In doing so, we observed a pattern where reflection and sense-making took place before engaging in any specific decision regarding the organizational design. The theoretical contribution of this research is to demonstrate the potential of pluralist theoretical frameworks for understanding complex phenomena such as organizational design in the context of managing multiple projects. More specifically, the process view of organizational design was found to reveal new insights that would have remained hidden otherwise. From a practical view, our research challenges certain utopian assumptions regarding the stability and replicability of a one-size-fits-all model in organizational design. Instead, we recommend developing an in-depth understanding of an organization's specific context by means of sense-making activities. The latter should be performed in an ongoing approach to ensure that the organizational design evolves in keeping with its environment.},

Instead of getting bogged down in the mathematics, this paper uses the implications of the existing literature to discuss the use of real options in the management of new product development through a combination of the real option theory and the theory of design. It is argued that development processes should be structured as staged investments to allow for flexibility and monitoring of created options in the process, since all subsequent development steps are dependent on the next one. The design of new solutions is then seen as the creation of new options. This is a way to handle risky projects in uncertain environments and create controlled radical change. A single case, from the development of web services in the newspaper industry, is viewed through the ‘real option design' lens. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Copyright of Inter},

abstract = {Sensemaking involves turning circumstances into a situation that is comprehended explicitly in words and that serves as a springboard into action. In this paper we take the position that the concept of sensemaking fills important gaps in organizational theory. The seemingly transient nature of sensemaking belies its central role in the determination of human behavior, whether people are acting in formal organizations or elsewhere. Sensemaking is central because it is the primary site where meanings materialize that inform and constrain identity and action. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the concept of sensemaking. We do so by pinpointing central features of sensemaking, some of which have been explicated but neglected, some of which have been assumed but not made explicit, some of which have changed in significance over time, and some of which have been missing all along or have gone awry. We sense joint enthusiasm to restate sensemaking in ways that make it more future oriented, more action oriented, more macro, more closely tied to organizing, meshed more boldly with identity, more visible, more behaviorally defined, less sedentary and backward looking, more infused with emotion and with issues of sensegiving and persuasion. These key enhancements provide a foundation upon which to build future studies that can strengthen the sensemaking perspective.},

abstract = {Organizations are dynamic, hierarchically structured entities. Such dynamism is reflected in the emergence of significant events at every organizational level. Despite this fact, there has been relatively little discussion about how events become meaningful and come to impact organizations across space and time. We address this gap by developing event system theory, which suggests that events become salient when they are novel, disruptive, and critical (reflecting an event's strength). Importantly, events can originate at any hierarchical level and their effects can remain within that level or travel up or down throughout the organization, changing or creating new behaviors, features, and events. This impact can extend over time as events vary in duration and timing or as event strength evolves. Event system theory provides a needed shift in focus for organizational theory and research by developing specific propositions articulating the interplay among event strength and the spatial and temporal processes through which events come to influence organizations.

The compression model assumes a well-known, rational process and relies on squeezing together or compressing the sequential steps of such a process. The experiential model assumes an uncertain process and relies on improvisation, real-time experience, and flexibility. The two models are tested using data from 72 product development projects drawn from European, Asian, and U.S. computer firms. The results indicate that using an experiential strategy of multiple design iterations, extensive testing, frequent project milestones, a powerful project leader, and a multifunctional team accelerates product development. In contrast, the compression strategy of supplier involvement, use of computer-aided design, and overlapping development steps describes fast pace only for mature industry segments. The results also show that planning and rewarding for schedule attainment are ineffective ways of accelerating pace. We conclude with linkages to punctuated equilibrium and selection models of adaptation, fast organizational processes, organic versus improvisational structures, and complexity theory},

abstract = {Research summary: Mental models, reflecting interdependencies among managerial choice variables, are not always correctly specified. Mental models can be underspecified, missing interdependencies, or overspecified, containing nonexistent interdependencies. Using a simulation model, we find that under- and overspecification have opposite effects on exploration, and thereby, performance. The effects are also opposite, depending on whether a manager controls all choice variables. The mechanism underlying our results is a feedback loop: misspecified mental models influence managerial learning about the effectiveness of choices; this learning guides how the environment is explored, which in turn, affects which information will be generated for future learning. We explore implications of these results for strategic management and introduce the notion of “cognitive fit” between the mental model of the decision-maker and the strategic environment. Managerial summary: Managers often rely on mental models to guide their decision-making. These mental models, however, are often misspecified, that is, more or less complex than the situation managers are facing. Using a simulation model, we study the consequences of such misspecified mental models. We find that the performance implications of misspecified mental models crucially depend on whether the manager controls all choice variables. We identify situations in which simpler mental models are better than overly complex ones, and vice versa.},

@article{Sethi2008,
abstract = {This article argues that Stage-Gate controls have the potential of restricting learning in a new product development project and thus hurting the performance of novel new products. Specifically, the authors examine whether control on new product development exercised through rigorous gate review criteria increases project inflexibility, which in turn leads to increased failure to learn.They also focus on whether the effect of project inflexibility is worsened when there is turbulence in the firm's technological and market environment. Furthermore, the authors study whether failure to learn can have an adverse effect on new product performance when the product is novel. Finally, they examine whether a certain relaxation in gate evaluation (gate conditionality) that has been suggested recently mitigates the adverse effect of rigorously enforced controls. The results, which are based on a survey of 120 projects that used the Stage-Gate process for new product development, show that repeated application of strictly enforced and objective evaluation criteria for improved control makes projects more inflexible.

@article{Nonaka1991,
abstract = {In an economy where the only certainty is uncertainty, the one sure source of lasting competitive advantage is knowledge. And yet, few managers understand the true nature of the knowledge-creating company--let alone know how to manage it. According to Japanese organizational theorist Ikujiro Nonaka, the problem is that most Western managers hold a too-narrow view of what knowledge is and what companies must do to exploit it. They believe that the only useful knowledge is "hard" (read: quantifiable) data. And they see the company as a kind of machine for "information processing." But there is another way to think about knowledge and its role in business organizations. It is found most commonly at highly successful Japanese companies such as Honda, Canon, Matsushita, and Sharp. Managers at these companies recognize that creating new knowledge is not simply a matter of mechanistically "processing" objective information. Rather, it depends on tapping the tacit and often highly subjective insights, intuitions, and ideals of employees. The means for making use of such knowledge are often "soft"--taking the form of slogans, metaphors, and symbols--but they are indispensable tools for continuous innovation. The reasons Japanese companies seem especially good at this holistic kind of knowledge creation are complicated. But the key lesson for managers is quite simple: much as manufacturers around the world have learned from Japanese manufacturing techniques, any company that wants to compete on knowledge must also learn from Japanese techniques of knowledge creation. Using vivid examples from leading Japanese companies, Nonaka proposes a fresh way to think about managerial roles and responsibilities, organizational design, and business practices in the knowledge-creating company.},

@article{Shahinur2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Cambridge University Press. This study deals with both a decision model for making decisions under epistemic uncertainty and how to use it for selecting optimal materials under the same uncertainty. In particular, the proposed decision model employs a set of possibilistic objective functions defined by fuzzy numbers to handle a set of conflicting criteria. In addition, the model can calculate the compliance of a piece of decision-relevant (imprecise) information with a given objective function. Moreover, the model is capable to aggregate the calculated compliances for the sake of ranking a given set of alternatives against the set of conflicting criteria. The problem of selecting materials for making the body of a vehicle is considered as an example. In this problem, the indices for selecting the materials are unknown because the specifications regarding the vehicle body are not given. In addition, the data relevant to material properties entails a great deal of imprecision. The presented decision model can quantify the above-mentioned epistemic uncertainty in a lucid manner and generate a list of optimal materials.},

@article{Kahneman1979a,
abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.},

@article{Sommer2004,
abstract = {Companies innovating in dynamic environments face the combined challenge of unforeseeable uncertainty (the inability to recognize the relevant influence variables and their functional relationships; thus, events and actions cannot be planned ahead of time) and high complexity (large number of variables and interactions; this leads to difficulty in assessing optimal actions beforehand). There are two fundamental strategies to manage innovation with unforeseeable uncertainty and complexity: trial and error learning and selectionism. Trial and error learning involves a flexible (unplanned) adjustment of the considered actions and targets to new information about the relevant environment as it emerges. Selectionism involves pursuing several approaches independently of one another and picking the best one ex post. Neither strategy nor project management literatures have compared the relative advantages of the two approaches in the presence of unforeseeable uncertainty and complexity. We build a model of a complex project with unforeseeable uncertainty, simulating problem solving as a local search on a rugged landscape. We compare the project payoff performance under trial and error learning and selectionism, based on a priori identifiable project characteristics: whether unforeseeable uncertainty is present, how high the complexity is, and how much trial and error learning and parallel trials cost. We find that if unforeseeable uncertainty is present and the team cannot run trials in a realistic user environment (indicating the project's true market performance), trial and error learning is preferred over selectionism. Moreover, the presence of unforeseeable uncertainty can reverse an established result from computational optimization: Without unforeseeable uncertainty, the optimal number of parallel trials increases in complexity. But with unforeseeable uncertainty, the optimal number of trials might decrease because the unforeseeable factors make the trials less a... [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Co-design activities are performed at dedicated interfaces and allow for the joint development of products and solutions between individual customers and manufacturers. Our research on co-design is based on a deep interaction with case companies, making the research itself a further collaborative effort. In this paper, we first explore collaboration challenges with a case company introducing customer co-design (Adidas AG, a sport goods manufacturer). In a second step of exploration, we use findings from a larger database of case studies on customer co-design or mass customization to identify four basic modes of cooperation between customers, retailers and manufacturers. In a final step, the understanding gained from this differentiation is refined using the Adidas case. From the perspective of management practice, our research contributes to a better understanding of the collaboration challenges following a customer-centric business strategy. From the perspective of management research, the paper provides both a conceptual model of cooperation demands at the customer interface and a methodological framework for collaborative management research between academics and companies.European Management Review (2005) 2, 7087, advance online publication, 3 June 2005},

This article provides an analysis of the extent to which innovation is compatible with recent managerial and technical methods (project and multi‐project management, co‐development, simulation tools and digital mock‐ups, etc.). The analysis is based on a recent development project conducted at Renault in which these various techniques were used in an attempt to achieve highly ambitious targets simultaneously in the areas of lead times, costs and innovation. During the course of the project, unexpected design problems revealed failures in co‐ordination, monitoring procedures and expertise.

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to use an organizational design perspective to determine the scope of the state-of-the art of research into project-based organizations. Design/methodology/approach – The paper follows a structured framework-based literature review approach. It uses an analytical framework from the organization design literature to assess 177 papers relevant to the design of the project-based organization that were published in four leading PM journals between 2008 and 2015. The authors determine which elements of organization design are covered in each paper and identify specific research themes for each of the element emerging from the literature. Finally, the authors examine the degree to which interdependencies among separate elements are addressed in the literature and discuss the most holistic papers in more details. Findings – The results show that the literature on project-based organizations downplays broader organizational issues (such as organizational strategy, incentive schemes and performance management systems) while emphasizing research agenda inherited from research on single project management. In addition, the study highlights limited attention in the literature to the interdependence between separate design choices. Finally, it develops a research framework to map current themes in the literature and their relative importance and discusses a prospective research agenda. Research limitations/implications – Academic implications stem from looking at the project management literature from a fresh theoretical perspective and putting project-based organization as a whole in the focus. There is a great research potential in studying organization-wide aspects and interdependencies between various organization design choices in project-based organizations. Practical implications – Reflective practitioners could benefit from a wider view on the project-based organization and its design. They could also use the developed framework in management discussions. Originality/value – The paper offers a novel way of conceptualizing research on project-based organizations by linking it to an established stream within the field of organization theory and design.

abstract = {One of the main themes that has emerged from behavioral decision research during the past 2 decades is the view that people's preferences are often constructed in the process of elicitation. This concept is derived in part from studies demonstrating that normatively equivalent methods of elicitation often give rise to systematically different responses. These "preference reversals" violate the principle of procedure invariance that is fundamental to theories of rational choice and raise difficult questions about the nature of human values. If different elicitation procedures produce different orderings of options, how can preferences be defined and in what sense do they exist? Describing and explaining such failures of invariance will require choice models of far greater complexity than the traditional models. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

@article{MacCormack2012,
abstract = {A variety of academic studies argue that a relationship exists between the structure of an organization and the design of the products that this organization produces. Specifically, products tend to "mirror" the architectures of the organizations in which they are developed. This dynamic occurs because the organization's governance structures, problem solving routines and communication patterns constrain the space in which it searches for new solutions. Such a relationship is important, given that product architecture has been shown to be an important predictor of product performance, product variety, process flexibility and even the path of industry evolution. We explore this relationship in the software industry. Our research takes advantage of a natural experiment, in that we observe products that fulfill the same function being developed by very different organizational forms. At one extreme are commercial software firms, in which the organizational participants are tightly-coupled, with respect to their goals, structure and behavior. At the other, are open source software communities, in which the participants are much more loosely-coupled by comparison. The mirroring hypothesis predicts that these different organizational forms will produce products with distinctly different architectures. Specifically, loosely-coupled organizations will develop more modular designs than tightly-coupled organizations. We test this hypothesis, using a sample of matched-pair products. We find strong evidence to support the mirroring hypothesis. In all of the pairs we examine, the product developed by the loosely-coupled organization is significantly more modular than the product from the tightly-coupled organization. We measure modularity by capturing the level of coupling between a product's components. The magnitude of the differences is substantial - up to a factor of six, in terms of the potential for a design change in one component to propagate to others. Our results have significant managerial implications, in highlighting the impact of organizational design decisions on the technical structure of the artifacts that these organizations subsequently develop. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Since the first edition of Managing the Unexpected was published in 2001, the unexpected has become a growing part of our everyday lives. The unexpected is often dramatic, as with hurricanes or terrorist attacks. But the unexpected can also come in more subtle forms, such as a small organizational lapse that leads to a major blunder, or an unexamined assumption that costs lives in a crisis. Why are some organizations better able than others to maintain function and structure in the face of unanticipated change? Authors Karl E. Weick and Kathleen M. Sutcliffe answer this question by pointing to high reliability organizations (HROs), such as emergency rooms in hospitals, flight operations of aircraft carriers, and firefighting units, as models to follow. These organizations have developed ways of acting and styles of learning that enable them to manage the unexpected better than other organizations. Thoroughly revised and updated, the second edition of the groundbreaking book Managing the Unexpected uses HROs as a template for any institution that wants to better organize for high reliability. The authors reveal how HROs create a collective state of mindfulness that produces an enhanced ability to discover and correct errors before they escalate into a crisis. A mindful infrastructure continually Tracks small failures Resists oversimplification Is sensitive to operations Maintains capabilities for resilience Takes advantage of shifting locations of expertise Through a discussion of the principle of mindfulness and the practices that can be used to apply it, the authors show how to anticipate and respond to threats with flexibility rather than rigidity. Their practical, solutions-oriented approach includes numerous case studies demonstrating mindful practices and enables readers to assess and implement mindfulness in their own organizations. Managing the Unexpected is a guide for learning the hard-won lessons of high reliability organizations that are able to manage unexpected threats and bounce back in a stronger position to tackle future challenges.},

To address these two questions on the objectives and contingency factors for open evaluation of new product concepts, this study applies exploratory multiple{\&}{\#}8208;case research of open evaluation in nine innovation contests.

Instead of being concerned with the efficient implementation of a delib- erate strategy, a project in such a context becomes a process for strategy formulation. Three imperatives for project management arise as a result: managing the explorative phase, managing the involvement of stake- holders in the project, and managing the project in relation to the strategizing process of the firm. We propose that design thinking, a recent evolution in the field of design, can make some important contributions to these imperatives. Design thinking has been high- lighted by practitioners as well as academia as a novel methodology that is potentially valuable for improving innovative outcomes, whether they are products, services, or strat- egies. We examine and articulate these pos- sible contributions through 10 propositions that could form an agenda for future experi- mentation and empirical research on innova- tion project management},

It is suggested that classical definitions of projects are not wrong, just incomplete. The project as a temporary organization is viewed here as a production function, as an agency for assigning resources to the management of change within the functional organization, and as an agency for managing uncertainty. The role of the project manager is also considered. The project manager is chief executive of the temporary organization, and thus their roles in objective setting and motivating team members are emphasized over their role in planning and executing work. Second, as manager of the agency, they are the agent of the owner (principal) and so a second hierarchy of management and control must be put in place to monitor their performance. These agency costs add to the cost of the project, but may also explain why professional recognition is so important to project managers. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and IPMA.

This issue is closely related to the problems of constructing an appropriate state space under conditions of deficient foresight about what the future might hold, and our aim is to develop a theory and some of the practicalities of state space elaboration that addresses these problems. Building on ideas originally put forward by Bacon (1620), we show how our approach can be used to build and explore the state space, how it may reduce the extent to which organisations are blindsided by Black Swans, and how it ameliorates various well-known cognitive biases.},

In all three experiments, the designs of subjects who had seen the examples were more likely to contain features of the examples. This conformity effect did not significantly decrease in Experiment 2, when a 23-mm task was interpolated between viewing the examples and generating related ideas. The hypothesis that the observed conformity effects may have been caused by subjects' assumptions that they should try to generate ideas similar to the examples was refuted in Experiment 3; explicitly instructing subjects to create ideas that were verydifferent from the examples did not decrease conformity to the examples, and instructing them to conform to the examples significantly increased conformity. The results show that recent experience can lead to unintentional conformity, constraining the generation of creative ideas.},

@book{Christensen1997,
abstract = {In this revolutionary bestseller, innovation expert Clayton M. Christensen says outstanding companies can do everything right and still lose their market leadership—or worse, disappear altogether. And not only does he prove what he says, but he tells others how to avoid a similar fate. Focusing on “disruptive technology,” Christensen shows why most companies miss out on new waves of innovation. Whether in electronics or retailing, a successful company with established products will get pushed aside unless managers know when to abandon traditional business practices. Using the lessons of successes and failures from leading companies, The Innovator's Dilemma presents a set of rules for capitalizing on the phenomenon of disruptive innovation. Find out: When it is right not to listen to customers. When to invest in developing lower-performance products that promise lower margins. When to pursue small markets at the expense of seemingly larger and more lucrative ones. Sharp, cogent, and provocative, The Innovator's Dilemma is one of the most talked-about books of our time—and one no savvy manager or entrepreneur should be without.},

abstract = {Various streams of organizational research have examined the relationship between creativity and leadership, albeit using slightly different names such as “creative leadership”, “leading for creativity and innovation”, and “managing creatives”. In this article, we review this dispersed body of knowledge and synthesize it under a global construct of creative leadership, which refers to leading others toward the attainment of a creative outcome. Under this unifying construct, we classify three more narrow conceptualizations that we observe in the literature: facilitating employee creativity; directing the materialization of a leader's creative vision; and integrating heterogeneous creative contributions. After examining the contextual characteristics associated with the three conceptualizations, we suggest that they represent three distinct collaborative contexts of creative leadership. We discuss the theoretical implications of a multi-context framework of creative leadership, especially in terms of resolving three persisting problems in the extant literature: lack of definitional clarity, shortage of nuanced theories, and low contextual sensitivity.},

We examine how this is used by managers, in a qualitative study in technology projects, to explain better how ambidexterity is achieved.Ambidexterity in the use of knowledge assets is shown to exist in the practices of managers but without them necessarily having a conscious strategy for it. We identify the mechanisms by which this happens and note the distinctive role of social capital. We demonstrate the integrative nature of the mechanisms, and how each mechanism can involve the deployment of either single or multiple elements of intellectual capital. In so doing we extend the existing theory to the operational level and demonstrate the utility of this approach.},

While much is written on the ‘what' of ambidexterity – its enactment has been shown to be beneficial – there is a gap in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, architectures and dynamics by which organisations can achieve both exploration and exploitation. In this article, we use the lens of intellectual capital to extend current architectural theory. A case study of a project management office in an IT/IS multinational provides the context in which to qualitatively unpack the underpinning intellectual capital architecture, illustrating the interwoven application of human, social and organisational capital in a complicated organisational setting. We reveal the co-existence and mutual interdependence of multiple intellectual capital and process elements, further explaining the ‘how' of this increasingly important area of study.},

abstract = {This chapter describes info-gap modeling as a stark theory of uncertainty, motivated by severe lack of information. It is facile enough to express the idea that uncertainty may be either pernicious or propitious. The pernicious and propitious aspects of uncertainty are quantified by two “immunity functions”: the robustness function expresses the immunity to failure, while the opportuneness function expresses the immunity to windfall gain. Info-gap decision theory is based on quantifying these two aspects of uncertainty, and choosing an action which addresses one or the other or both of them simultaneously. The immunity functions are obtained in this chapter by combining three distinct elements: a system model, a performance requirement, and an uncertainty model. An info-gap analysis begins with these three components. These functions are formulated in the chapter. Following this, series of examples drawn from a wide range of disciplines is presented.},

abstract = {Presents a series of studies showing that the sources of innovation vary greatly; possible sources include innovation users, suppliers of innovation-related components, and product manufacturers. These types of roles are known as functional areas. Specific areas of innovation are marked by having innovators predominantly in one specific functional area. Using empirical data from industrial histories, the authors show that this innovation-function relationship has held in scientific instrument, semiconductor and printed circuit board assembly process innovations. Users are predominantly the innovators in these fields. Also identifies a few industries where manufacturers are typically the innovators and a few others where suppliers tend to be. Analysis of the economic rents of innovation expected by potential innovators can often, if not always, by itself predict the functional source of innovation. Innovating firms will do so only when these rents prove attractive. Two factors suggest that this will tend to limit exploitation of the innovation to a functional area. First, it is difficult for innovators to adopt new functional relationships to their innovations. Second, innovators face a poor ability to capture innovation rents by licensing their innovation-related knowledge to others. This hypothesis and its implications are tested against the empirical datasets used initially. The role of informal R{\&}D know-how trading is also discussed and analyzed using the Prisoner's Dilemma. Guidance is given to innovation managers and policymakers. (CAR)},

In thepaper,weargue that designing organizations should be scientific-based and forward-looking. This raises challenges in designing organizations in contexts and situations that are new and have not been seen before. Experimentation of what is and what might be is the basis for exploring and examining what makes a good science for organizational design. Experimentation permits us to examine what might be for organization designs, which are not well understood or may not exist yet. Collaborative communities, new ventures, agile organizations, and temporary organizations are examples; experimentation permits us explore and examine what is and what might be and to examine the organizational design problem and perform experiments to understand the relationship between structure and coordination mechanisms of information, communications, decisions, trust, and incentives—the basis for the multi-contingency theory of organizational design. An organizational design must specify the fit between the structure of division of tasks in the organization with its coordination, or how to make these tasks work in concert. These tasks can be interdependent and uncertain. To design good organizations, we need empirical evidence about what is and exploration about what might be; we need a good theoretical basis for being able to generalize our knowledge. To illustrate our point, we examine two experiments on the classic M-form hypothesis—a computer simulation that examines coordination, organization structure, and interdependency and a laboratory experiment that examines the effect of incentives on opportunism and performance. Together, we find that the M-form is a robust organizational design, but with contingent conditions. Finally, we discuss how observation and experimentation together is the foundation for the development of scientific-based theory of organizational design},

This research approach is especially appropriate in new topic areas. The resultant theory is often novel, testable, and empirically valid. Finally, framebreaking insights, the tests of good theory (e.g., parsimony, logical coherence), and convincing grounding in the evidence are the key criteria for evaluating this type of research.},

abstract = {Innovation literature stresses the importance of opening the innovation process to internal and external innovators. The question of what determines the integration of these types of innovators in the innovation process remains open. We use a sociotechnical systems perspective to address a number of challenges with respect to this matter: an organization deploying different innovation practices to open the innovation process might not be aware which types of innovators are de facto integrated in its innovation process. Alternatively, an organization targeting the integration of a particular type of innovator might not use the suitable innovation practices to integrate the knowledge of this type of innovator. To address these challenges, our comparative case-study analysis in 15 medium-sized firms derives a theoretical framework proposing that a combined analysis of innovation practices and underlying social interactions is needed to decide about the integration of a particular type of innovator in the innovation process. Being aware of these interrelations will allow organizations to act more consciously when opening their innovation processes.  },

abstract = {Novel startup companies often face no only risk, ut also unforeseeable uncertainty (the inability to recognize and articulate all relevant variables affecting performance). The literature recognized that established risk planning methods are very powerful when the nature of risks is well understood, but that they are insufficient for managing unforeseeable uncertainty. For this case, two fundamental approaches have been identified: trial-and-error learning, or actively searching for information and repeatedly changing the goals and course of action as new information emerges, and selectionism,or pursuing several approaches in parallel to see ex post what works best. Based on a sample of 58 startups in Shanghai, we test predictions from prior literature on the circumstances under which selectionism or trial-and-error learning leads to higher performance. We find that the best approach depends on a combination of uncertainty and complexity of the startup: risk planning is sufficient when both are low; trial-and-error learning promises the highest potential when unforeseeable uncertainty is high, and selectionism is preferred when both unforeseeable uncertainty and complexity are high, provided that the choice of the best trial can be delayed until its true market performance can be assessed.},

At the start of the project, the members do not know the value that would be finally delivered: the value is not determined ex-ante but it is designed during the project. Based on the analysis of a creative project regarding future electric vehicles at Renault, our VM framework considers three elements: (1) the value to be managed is the new knowledge and the concepts of new products/services, (2) the value of a creative project is managed by controlling the distance between the new knowledge/new concepts and the dominant design (i.e. main products and business model), (3) the value created is beneficial to both the project stakeholders and the actors of surrounding ecosystems.},

As a member of the Technology and Operations Management unit of Harvard Business School, he participated in several major research initiatives during the 1980s and early 1990s, before becoming Dean of the School in 1995. And even as Dean, he continued to pursue research until 2005, when he left Harvard to become President of Brigham Young UniversityIdaho. In this paper, we describe Clarks research and discuss his contributions to management and economics. We look at three distinct bodies of work. In the first, Clark (in conjunction with Robert Hayes and Steven Wheelwright) argued that the abandonment by U.S. managers of manufacturing as a strategic function exposed U.S. companies to Japanese competition. In the second research stream, conducted with Wheelwright, Bruce Chew, Takahiro Fujimoto, Kent Bowen and Marco Iansiti, Clark made the case that product development could be managed in new ways that would lead to significant competitive advantage for firms. Finally, in work conducted with Abernathy, Rebecca Henderson and Carliss Baldwin, Clark placed product and process designs at the center of his explanation of how innovation determines the structure and evolution of industries.},

abstract = {Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) is a strategic posture of an organization, and it is related to basic policies and practices for the development of entrepreneurial actions looking for creating competitive advantages. This study develops and tests a model of the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and project success in Brazilian context. As quantitative research, a survey was used to collect data. A sample of 100 valid answers from project practitioners was treated through the structural equation modeling method. As research implications, the main result points out the positive correlation between the entrepreneurial orientation and the project success, contributing to the development of this research subject and helping to minimize the gap in the literature that addresses the relationship between project success and EO. In practical terms, understanding that innovativeness, risk taking, proactiveness, autonomy and competitive aggressiveness (the dimensions of the EO) can contribute to project success and can also indirectly impact on organizational performance, could help organizations get competitive advantage when developing correlate factors. Finally, the results suggest that practices of project management can be aligned to the firm's entrepreneurial orientation to enable firms to attain better results in their projects and generate a competitive advantage. On other hand, given the proportion of the impact of EO on project success (20.3{\%}) identified in this study, it is critical that project management professionals expand their horizon to recognize other factors that affect project success.},

abstract = {Balancing exploration and exploitation is a critical challenge that is particularly difficult for smaller, nascent organizations that lack the resources, capabilities, and experience necessary to successfully implement ambidexterity. To better understand how small and medium-sized enterprises achieve ambidexterity, we develop theoretical arguments that link organizational performance to strategic combinations of exploration and exploitation in both product and market domains. We test the hypotheses with a longitudinal study in a dynamic industry that combines objective measures of competition, firm size, age, and revenue performance with self-reported measures of product and market exploration and exploitation. The empirical results offer new insights with respect to several tensions at the heart of the ambidexterity challenge: (1) pure strategies that combine product exploration with market exploration or product exploitation with market exploitation have complementary interaction effects on revenue, (2) cross-functional ambidexterity combining product exploitation with market exploration also exerts complementary interaction effects on revenue, (3) product ambidexterity has positive effects on revenue for older and larger—but not younger and smaller—firms, and (4) market ambidexterity has positive effects on revenue for larger—but not smaller, younger, or older—firms. Two ambidexterity paradoxes emerge: (1) larger, older firms have the resources, capabilities, and experience required to benefit from a product ambidexterity strategy, but larger, older firms are less likely to implement product ambidexterity; and (2) only larger firms have the resources and capabilities required to benefit from a market ambidexterity strategy, but developing and sustaining market ambidexterity is necessary to drive long-term growth.},

abstract = {After treating action as peripheral for decades, cognitive scientists increasingly appreciate the fundamental roles it plays throughout cognition. Because action shapes cognitive processes pervasively, some theorists propose that cognition can be reduced to action. I propose that the central roles of action in human cognition depend on important processes that mediate between stimuli and responses. From this perspective, the unique features of human cognition do not simply reflect a remarkable potential for action, but also powerful abilities that mediate action in response to the environment. Sophisticated action results from sophisticated mediation, in particular, from mediating processes associated with representation, conceptualization, internal state attribution, affect, and self-regulation. Integrated with action systems, these mediating processes endow humans with unusually flexible and powerful means of shaping their physical and social environments. Without taking these mediating processes into account, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to explain human action. It may also be difficult to explain basic cognitive phenomena associated with memory, concepts, categorization, symbolic operations, language, problem solving, decision making, motivation, emotion, reward, self, mentalizing, and social cognition. Instead of reducing cognition to action, an alternative project is to develop a viable theory that does justice to the importance of action in cognition, while integrating mediating processes that complement it.},

Through four case studies in the video-game industry, multimedia, advertising and a circus, we propose an integrated synthesis of what creative project managers actually do. Beyond analytical, cognitive, psychological, symbolic and discursive activities, we identify four sets of activities carefully coined to acknowledge the everyday work of project manager involved in creative projects. We suggest that this project manager acts as a sense-maker, a web-weaver, a game-master and a flow-balancer.

If the strategically most important re- source of the firm is knowledge, and if knowledge resides in specialized form among individual organizational members, then the essence of organizational capability is the integra- tion of individuals' specialized knowledge. This paper develops a knowledge-based theory of organi- zational capability, and draws upon research into competitive dynamics, the resource-based view of the firm, organizational capabilities, and organizational learning. Central to the the- oiy is analysis of the mechanisms through which knowledge is integrated within firms in order to create capability. The theory is used to explore firms' potential for establishing competitive advantage in dynamic market settings, including the role of firm networks under conditions of unstable link- ages between knowledge inputs and product outputs. The analysis points to the difficulties in creating the "dynamic" and "flexible-response capabilities" which have been deemed critical to success in hypercompetitive markets.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to define and explain the front end of product innovation as a discrete segment of development between research and product development. The Valley of Death is used as a metaphor to describe the relative lack of resources and expertise in this area of development. The metaphor suggests that there are relative more resources on one side of the valley in the form of research expertise and on the other side by commercialization expertise and resources. Within this valley a set of interlocking roles are examined that move projects from one side to the other. The empirical methodology used in this study gathered data from 272 Product Development {\&} Management Association (PDMA) members with extensive experience in the front end of product development using a Web-based survey instrument. Extensive pretests with experienced practitioners were conducted to develop the instrument. Results indicate that significant development takes place before projects enter into a firm's formal product development process. The data also support the roles of champion, sponsor, and gatekeeper as major actors that work together to develop and promote projects for introduction into the formal process. Champions make the organization aware of opportunities by conceptualizing the idea and preparing business cases. Sponsors support the development of promising ideas by providing resources to demonstrate the project's viability. Gatekeepers set criteria and make acceptance decisions. The data also reveal a dynamic interdependence between role players. It is concluded that the Valley of Death is a productive tool for identifying and understanding a critical area of development that has not been adequately addressed. This research finds a dynamic interplay between roles to accomplish tasks that are not well understood in practice or the literature. The implications of this research are far-ranging. It suggests that companies must understand the challenges in the valley, must develop the skills, and must make resources available to master the front end of product innovation. Recognizing roles, providing resources, and establishing expectations and accountability in this area of development become manageable in light of these results. Theoretically, this research informs role theory of a dynamic set of relationships previously treated as static. It also empirically investigates an area of product development where there is limited data. This paper opens profitable inquiries by focusing on an area of development not adequately researched yet drives the activities and investment made in subsequent steps of product development.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to extend the concept of dynamic capabilities. Building on prior research, we suggest that there are three levels of dynamic capabilities which are related to managers' perceptions of environmental dynamism. At the first level we find incremental dynamic capabilities: those capabilities concerned with the continuous improvement of the firm's resource base. At the second level are renewing dynamic capabilities, those that refresh, adapt and augment the resource base. These two levels are usually conceived as one and represent what the literature refers to as dynamic capabilities. At the third level are regenerative dynamic capabilities, which impact, not on the firm's resource base, but on its current set of dynamic capabilities, i.e. these change the way the firm changes its resource base. We explore the three levels using illustrative examples and conclude that regenerative dynamic capabilities may either come from inside the firm or enter the firm from outside, via changes in leadership or the intervention of external change agents.},

abstract = {How do organizations survive in the face of change? Underlying this question is a rich debate about whether organizations can adaptand if so how. One perspective, organizational ecology, presents evidence suggesting that most organizations are largely inert and ultimately fail. A second perspective argues that some firms do learn and adapt to shifting environmental contexts. Recently, this latter view has coalesced around two themes. The first, based on research in strategy suggests that dynamic capabilities, the ability of a firm to reconfigure assets and existing capabilities, explains long-term competitive advantage. The second, based on organizational design, argues that ambidexterity, the ability of a firm to simultaneously explore and exploit, enables a firm to adapt over time. In this paper we review and integrate these comparatively new research streams and identify a set of propositions that suggest how ambidexterity acts as a dynamic capability. We suggest that efficiency and innovation need not be strategic tradeoffs and highlight the substantive role of senior teams in building dynamic capabilities.},

abstract = {Complex technologies are often developed in inter-organisational networks as actors try to reduce development costs and uncertainty about the viability of these innovations. However, as of to date it remains unclear how such innovations are financed collectively under conditions characterised by extreme uncertainty. Hence we explore how financial resources within innovation networks are mobilised and allocated. This question is of particular importance to the development of system technologies that are viable only if all critical components are functional on time. We explore this issue by reviewing the development of a radically new system technology for mass manufacturing microchips in the semiconductor industry. In this industry, technological roadmaps allow actors to identify critical components that still need to be developed. These components are the so-called roadmap gaps. However, suppliers can be reluctant to develop the required components at their own expense because of the high uncertainties involved. In such cases, providing financial support to component suppliers is a central task of innovation networks. The empirical analysis shows that semiconductor manufacturers take both an individual and a collective approach to filling roadmap gaps. This study contributes to prior research on innovation networks and financial management not only by identifying and clarifying these two approaches, but also by revealing under which conditions they are used. The findings are particularly relevant to scholars interested in the innovations of complex product systems (CoPS). ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Christiansen2009,
abstract = {Many scholars consider the use of formal structured approaches to manage product development as very significant for successful product innovation. Others consider them a predictor of the likely outcome of the processes. Struc- tured approaches can be considered management technologies for product development. Prior research has addressed the design of structured approaches and has measured how different types or generations of these are related to different processes and outcomes in different ways. However, only limited research has addressed how managers and employees actually understand and makes sense of these methods. This paper investigates how structured approaches are translated through a number of interpretations into daily practices. The research draws on research in sociology and management accounting to analyze structured approaches for product development as a managerial technology that consists of rules that individuals must understand (i.e., make sense of). The paper presents arguments for building a model of factors that influence the sensemaking of structured approaches for product development based on Scandinavian cases. First, structured approaches are presented as a type of man- agerial technology that consists of rules. Second, a framework to classify structured approaches for product de- velopment according to their degree of elaborateness and exhaustiveness is derived. This helps to identify the types of rule systems in companies—and how these influence everyday practices. The sensemaking from rules to practice is implemented through a number of translations, based on the context, the history, and the authorized statements and feedback processes. Empirical findings show that structured approaches differ both with respect to their degree of elaborateness and exhaustiveness. Additionally, firms differ greatly in terms of how rigorously they enforce the rules. Furthermore, the importance assigned to them by functional managers and project managers differ greatly. Even companies with extensive and elaborate rule regimes enforce the rules in a flexible manner, and rules are often applied at the discretion of project managers. Practices are influenced by the interpretation, use, and feedback from senior managers. Observations make it possible to develop a model for the sensemaking processes that influences how a specific structured approach through sensemaking is altered, modified, and sometimes even cut off from influencing innovation processes. The sensemaking of rules might reverse elaborate and exhaustive rules into quite flexible systems in practice. One implication of this is that individual sensemaking of structured approaches for product development thus needs to be analyzed to understand managerial practices. Another implication is that it cannot be assumed, a priori that formal approaches are the same as exercised practices. Introduction},

abstract = {Sketches are an essential tool for designers. They allow the externalizing of ideas and are therefore economic cognitively. Sketches also provide the designer with new insights, which play an important role in the emergence of ideas. However, some studies tend to show that sketching does not systematically have a positive effect on idea generation. Our research thus aims to analyze the generative effects of sketches by studying the way sketches support the design strategy of designers. We especially focus on the role of knowledge in comparison with concepts. Three sequences of sketches are analyzed employing C–K design theory; we show that drawings refer to both concepts and knowledge, but mostly to knowledge. In particular, sketching helps the architect mobilize knowledge distant from the initial topic. Moreover, the designer carries out through sketching an important work of knowledge structuration that we call ‘knowledge preordering'; by carefully selecting, testing and, if necessary, removing knowledge, the designer organizes a strategically built knowledge space. In particular, all elements involving modularity or determinism in the knowledge basis are abandoned. Such knowledge preordering thus allows the building of a splitting knowledge structure, which offers new rules for concept generation and enhances the production of original and disruptive ideas.},

abstract = {This paper takes a critical look at the design thinking discourse, one that has different meanings depending on its context. Within the managerial realm, design thinking has been described as the best way to be creative and innovate, while within the design realm, design thinking may be partly ignored and taken for granted, despite a long history of academic development and debate. In the design area, we find five different discourses of ‘designerly thinking', or ways to describe what designers do in practice, that have distinctly different epistemological roots. These different discourses do not stand in competition with each other but could be developed in parallel. We also observe that the management discourse has three distinct origins, but in general has a more superficial and popular character and is less academically anchored than the designerly one. Also, the management design thinking discourse seldom refers to designerly thinking and thereby hinders cumulative knowledge construction. We suggest further research to link the discourses.},

abstract = {nformation systems (IS) research has been long concerned with improving task‐related performance. The concept of fit is often used to explain how system design can improve performance and overall value. So far, the literature has focused mainly on performance evaluation criteria that are based on measures of task efficiency, accuracy, or productivity. However, nowadays, productivity gain is no longer the single evaluation criterion. In many instances, computer systems are expected to enhance our creativity, reveal opportunities and open new vistas of uncharted frontiers. To address this void, we introduce the concept of generativity in the context of IS design and develop two corresponding design considerations –‘generative capacity' that refers to one's ability to produce something ingenious or at least new in a particular context, and ‘generative fit' that refers to the extent to which an IT artefact is conducive to evoking and enhancing that generative capacity. We offer an extended view of the concept of fit and realign the prevailing approaches to human–computer interaction design with current leading‐edge applications and users' expectations. Our findings guide systems designers who aim to enhance creative work, unstructured syntheses, serendipitous discoveries, and any other form of computer‐aided tasks that involve unexplored outcomes or aim to enhance our ability to go boldly where no one has gone before. In this paper, we explore the underpinnings of ‘generative capacity' and argue that it should be included in the evaluation of task‐related performance. Then, we briefly explore the role of fit in IS research, position ‘generative fit' in that context, explain its role and impact on performance, and provide key design considerations that enhance generative fit. Finally, we demonstrate our thesis with an illustrative vignette of good generative fit, and conclude with ideas for further research.},

abstract = {Decision-making as a central concept in management and organization theory has had a colourful and controversial career spanning some 50 years. During this time its image and meaning has shifted substantially to the point where its expla- natory value as an established conceptual category in management and organiza- tional analysis has been questioned. In this article, I attempt a critical study of the concept of decision and try to show that the various attempts to replace it by other terms such as ‘action', and ‘change', overlook the ontological status of the decision-making process. I argue here that decision is better understood as a series of interlocking pre-definitive acts of punctuating the flow of human experi- ences in order to facilitate sense-making and to alleviate our Cartesian anxiety. Decisions are not so much about ‘choice' or ‘intentions' as about the primordial ‘will to order' whereby interlocking configurations of micro-inckwns punctuating our phenomenal experiences contrive to construct and reinforce a stable but pre- carious version of reality. When viewed thus, decision-making takes on a very different meaning - one that accentuates the concrete everydayness of micro- decisional acts which re-enact the ongoing contestation between order and disorder, routinization and breakdown, organization and disorganization, chaos and cosmos. Such micro-decisional ontologzcal acts are wliat produces and sustains a version of reality to which we then subsequently respond. It is this ‘becoming' theory of decision-making which is offered as an alternative to the ‘event' driven model of decisional theorizing.},

From the Eurotunnel linking Britain and France to expansion of the Panama Canal, huge projects often run off course or encounter nagging roadblocks. In this article, we illustrate three core management shortcomings that have significantly contributed to performance problems in megaprojects: the management of uncertainty, of stakeholders, and of contractors. We then draw on history – the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb during World War II, and Cold War-era space and defense projects like Polaris and Apollo – to show that knowledge of how to overcome these issues has long existed, and could be used effectively in some megaprojects today. For example, Manhattan Project manager General Groves realized that big unforeseeable uncertainties in designing atomic weapons required discrete project management skills including flexibility, but these techniques have since been pushed aside in a managerial push for control that became the phased-planning or “stage-gate” process philosophy. And while some 1940s and 1950s successes may not be repeated today with the same managerial methods, because stakeholder complexity was lower at a time when huge projects served “national priorities,” we argue that some mid-20th Century managerial techniques such as maintaining a common direction would help improve modern megaprojects.},

We argue that narrative development processes make this organizational learning possible. By developing narratives, organizational actors create situated understandings of unusual experiences, negotiate consensual meanings, and engage in coordinated actions. Through the accumulation of narratives about unusual experiences, an organization builds a memory with generative qualities. Specifically, through narratives, actors evoke memories of prior unusual experiences and how they were dealt with, and this generates new options for dealing with emerging unusual experiences. We outline a framework detailing how narrative development processes enable organizational learning from unusual experiences and conclude by summarizing how this approach differs from and yet builds upon scientific and experiential approaches to learning.},

I explain that free innovation is an inherently simple, transaction-free, grassroots innovation process engaged in by tens of millions of people in the household sector of national economies. Unlike producer innovation, free innovation does not require intellectual property rights to function. Indeed, from the perspective of participants, free innovation is fundamentally not about money – it is about human flourishing.},

abstract = {There is no one who in recent years has done more to shape the field of management than Ikujiro Nonaka. The body of work produced over the past two decades has been very influential, both in theory development and in management practice. Ikujiro Nonaka is a University of California, Berkeley graduate who has been the Xerox Distinguished Professor at the Haas School of Business for almost a decade. But it is not his UC Berkeley lineage that causes me to give praise to a great colleague and friend. Rather, it is his deep insights into the management of the new product development process, and his efforts to help us understand the role of both leaders and middle management in knowledge creation. Ikujiro Nonaka has become, for many of us, the new Peter Drucker offering a deep intuitive understanding of management and the ability to see gaps and deficiencies in existing theories, as well as emerging trends which will impact on the nature of the business enterprise and its management. In what follows, I give a selective and perhaps personal history of the field of knowledge management, and try to position his important contributions.},

This study which is partially funded by the Project Management Institute specifically investigates project management research in allied disciplines from 18 top management and business journal publications and categorizes it into eight allied disciplines. The evolution and trends of project management research are analyzed by exploring, identifying, and classifying management journal articles on project management in the allied disciplines. The analysis of project management research in the allied disciplines reveals an explosion of popularity and strong interest in project management research. The ranking of occurrences of the eight allied disciplines from most to the least appeared subjects over the last 50 years are (1) Strategy/Portfolio Management; (2) Operations Research/Decision Sciences; (3) Organizational Behavior/Human Resources Management; (4) Information Technology/Information Systems; (5) Technology Applications/Innovation; (6) Performance Management/Earned Value Management; (7) Engineering and Construction; and (8) Quality Management/Six Sigma. Result of this study help us better understand the evolution of project management as a field of practice and an academic discipline, and allow us to provide suggestions for future project management research opportunities. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.},

abstract = {Concept generation, an activity in which a number of design concepts are generated for further evaluation through prototyping and testing, is an important stage in the engineering design process. In design practice and design education, concept generation is often conducted in teams. During this activity, designers interact with one another to generate a number of design concepts. Prior research has either looked into the inter-relations between concepts generated, or into identifying specific interpersonal response behaviors in teams. There is a lack of explanation of how design concepts are generated moment-to-moment from the interpersonal interactions between designers. This paper presents the development of a visual notation called the Interaction Dynamics Notation for representing moment-to-moment concept generation through interpersonal interactions. This notation was developed through a video-observation study conducted with two engineering design teams engaged in a concept generation activity. Collective improvization was used to bridge concept generation and interpersonal behaviors into a single point of view for developing the notation. The validity of the notation is discussed in comparison with Linkography. The notation is shown to be effective in revealing patterns of interaction previously unfamiliar to design research.},

How well does this notion of “demand-pull” apply to non-incremental technological change when demand is largely attributable to actions by governments? In this case, inventors of the most important inventions did not respond positively to strong demand-pull policies; filing of highly cited patents declined precipitously just as demand for wind power created a multi-billion dollar market. Three explanations for this apparent inconsistency with the demand-pull hypothesis played a role: (1) the rapid convergence on a single dominant design limited the market opportunity for non-incremental technical improvements; (2) even though the policies implemented were stringent enough to stimulate demand, uncertainty in their longevity dampened the incentives for inventions that were likely to take several years to pay off; and (3) alternative explanations, such as declining R{\&}D funding and weakening presidential engagement on energy, appear to have been important.},

abstract = {College students imagined animals that might live on a planet somewhere else in the galaxy. In the first experiment, they provided drawings and descriptions of their initial imagined animal, another member of the same species, and a member of a different species. The majority of imagined creatures were structured by properties that are typical of animals on earth: bilateral symmetry, sensory receptors, and appendages. Subjects also allowed shape, appendages and sense receptors to vary often across species but rarely within species. In Experiment 2, subjects' creations were influenced by correlated attributes; those told that the animal was feathered were more likely to produce creatures with wings and beaks, and those told it lived in water and had scales were more likely to produce creatures with fins and gills relative to subjects who were told the animal was furry or who were given no specific features. Experiments 3 and 4 revealed that many subjects approach the task by retrieving exemplars of known earth animals, but that instructions and task constraints can lead to greater use of broader knowledge frameworks. Experiment 5 revealed that the structuring found in college students' imagined animals also holds for extraterrestrials developed by science fiction writers. The results are consistent with the idea that similar structures and processes underlie creative and noncreative aspects of cognition, and are discussed in terms of the concept of structured imagination. That is, when subjects create a new member of a known category for an imaginary setting, their imagination is structured by a particular set of properties that are characteristic of that category},

@article{Hobday2000,
abstract = {This paper examines the effectiveness of producing so-called CoPS (i.e., complex high value products, systems, networks, capital goods, and constructs) in a project-based organisation (PBO), as compared with a more traditional functional matrix organisation. A simple model is developed to show how the PBO relates to identified forms of matrix and functional organisation and a case study is used to identify some of the strengths and weaknesses of the two organisational forms for CoPS production. On the positive side, the PBO is an intrinsically innovative form as it creates and recreates new organisational structures around the demands of each CoPS project and each major customer. The PBO is able to cope with emerging properties in production and respond flexibly to changing client needs. It is also effective at integrating different types of knowledge and skill and coping with the project risks and uncertainties common in CoPS projects. However, the PBO is inherently weak where the matrix organisation is strong: in performing routine tasks, achieving economies of scale, coordinating cross-project resources, facilitating company wide technical development, and promoting organisation-wide learning. The PBO can also work against the wider interests of corporate strategy and business coordination. Strategies to stimulate organisational learning and technical leadership include the deployment of coordinators along functional lines to cut across project interests and incentives. Project tracking and guidance at the corporate level is also important for achieving broader business goals. The paper illustrates the wide variety of organisational choices involved in producing CoPS and argues that the nature, composition, and scale of the product in question have an important bearing on appropriate organisational form.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of applying general rules in organ- izations to govern multiple new product development projects. Data were collected in structured interviews with project managers and project members from seven successful projects within Swedish companies. Results show that projects either broke rules or that organizations had developed strategies to cope with the risk of rules preventing the progress of the projects. The project managers of the rule following projects reported lack of rule breaking to be the result of the rule design at each company, intending to minimize the risk of rules preventing the progress of projects. With the exception of the manager of the rule changing/removing project, project managers show a relaxed attitude to breaking general rules that hinder project progress. The study indicates that frameworks of common project management rules increase the risk of delay in new product development projects, unless strategies of rule breaking or dynamic rule modification are applied. Applications of emergent standard management philosophies and practices to innovation are discussed. ‘‘Written},

First, organizations adapt not only to technical pressures but also to what they believe society expects of them, which leads to institutional isomorphism. Organizations need a societal mandate, or legitimacy, to operate and this is gained by conforming to societal expectations. Second, when adaptations to institutional pressures contradict internal efficiency needs, organizations sometimes claim to adapt when they in reality do not; they decouple},

abstract = {How can we prepare engineering students to work collectively on innovative design issues, involving ill-defined, “wicked” problems? Recent works have emphasized the need for students to learn to combine divergent and convergent thinking in a collaborative, controlled manner. From this perspective, teaching must help them overcome four types of obstacles or “fixa- tion effects” (FEs) that are found in the generation of alternatives, knowledge acquisition, collaborative creativity, and crea- tivity processes.We begin by showing that teaching based on concept–knowledge (C-K) theory can help to manage FEs because it helps to clarify them and then to overcome them by providing means of action. We show that C-K theory can provide scaffolding to improve project-based learning (PBL), in what we call project-based critical learning (PBCL). PBCL helps students be critical and give due thought to the main issues in innovative design education: FEs.We illustrate the PBCL process with several cases and showprecisely where the FEs appear and howstudents are able to overcome them. We conclude by discussing two main criteria of any teaching method, both of which are usually difficult to address in sit- uations of innovative design teaching. First, can the method be evaluated? Second, is the chosen case “realistic” enough? We showthat C-K-based PBCL can be rigorously evaluated by teachers, andwe discuss the circumstances in which a C-K- based PBCL may or may not be realistic.},

The Carnegie approach incorporates the first two, but has little to say about the third.

Many make genuine efforts to be innovative--they spend on R{\&}D, bring in creative designers, hire innovation consultants. But they get disappointing results. Why? In "The Design of Business," Roger L. Martin offers a compelling and provocative answer: we rely far too exclusively on analytical thinking, which merely refines current knowledge, producing small improvements to the status quo. To innovate and win, companies need design thinking. This form of thinking is rooted in how knowledge advances from one stage to another--from mystery (something we can't explain) to heuristic (a rule of thumb that guides us toward solution) to algorithm (a predictable formula for producing an answer) to code (when the formula becomes so predictable it can be fully automated). As knowledge advances across the stages, productivity grows and costs drop--creating massive value for companies. Martin shows how leading companies such as Procter {\&} Gamble, Cirque du Soleil, RIM, and others use design thinking to push knowledge through the stages in ways that produce breakthrough innovations and competitive advantage. Filled with deep insights and fresh perspectives, "The Design of Business" reveals the true foundation of successful, profitable innovation.},

@article{Nohria1997,
abstract = {The relationship between organizational slack and innovation has remained an unanswered empirical question for decades and theorists continue to argue over the basic issue of whether slack facilitates or inhibits innovation. Opponents of slack claim that slack relaxes incentives to innovate and encourages wasteful investment in R{\&}D activities, while its proponents counter that slack resources allow individuals and departments to experiment with projects that might lead to important innovations. In this article, Nitin Nohria and Ranjay Gulati attempt to reconcile the theoretical debate by postulating that slack is neither inherently destructive to an organization, nor is it a fail-safe cure. By discouraging any form of experimentation whose success is uncertain, too little slack inhibits innovation. Similarly, an abundance of slack inhibits innovation by fostering complacency and lax controls. These two extremes suggest the notion that an intermediate level of slack is optimal for innovation in any organizational setting. Multivariate analyses of survey data from 264 functional departments of two multinational corporations support the authors' proposition that both too much and too little slack are detrimental for innovation. Thus, the authors argue that rather than focusing on whether slack has a uniformly positive or negative effect on innovation, theorists and managers should instead ask the question, ‘What is the optimal amount of slack?'},

To energize further uses of a paradox perspective, we build from past reviews to explicate its role as a metatheory. Contrasting this lens to contingency theory, we illustrate its metatheoretical nature. We then dive deeper to sharpen the focus and widen the scope of a paradox perspective. Identifying core elements viewed from a paradox perspective—underlying assumptions, central concepts, nature of interrelationships and boundary conditions—offers a guide, informing the practice of paradox research. Next, we illustrate diverse uses of this lens.

abstract = {The generation of architectural form is by definition a creative activity. As a rule, architects engage in intensive, fast, freehand sketching when they first tackle a design task. This study investigated the process of sketching and revealed that by sketching, the designer does not represent images held in the mind, as is often the case in lay sketching, but creates visual displays which help induce images of the entity that is being designed. Sketching partakes in design reasoning and it does so through a special kind of visual imagery. A pattern of pictorial reasoning is revealed which displays regular shifts between two modalities of arguments, pertaining to both figural and nonfigural aspects of candidate forms at the time they are being generated, as part of the design search. The dialectics of sketching is the oscillation of arguments which brings about gradual transformation of images, ending when the designer judges that sufficient coherence has been achieved.},

The research was prompted by the growing interest in the UK in design and its contribution to business performance, and the need to replace anecdote about 'best practice' in organizing and utilizing design, with information about more 'general' practice. After defining design as 'a course of action for the development of an artefact' and suggesting that design activity pervades organizations, the paper describes the methodology used to examine how design is organized. Using matrices to explore the interaction of design with other business functions the report suggests that 'silent design' (that is design by people who are not designers and are not aware that they are participating in design activity) goes on in all the organizations examined, even those which have formal design policies and open design activities. It is the scope and nature of 'silent design', and its conflict and/or cooperation with formal design activity, which will form the basis for the hypothesis on which the wider investigation will be built. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

Project-based organizations refer to a variety of organizational forms that involve the creation of temporary systems for the performance of project tasks. Project-based organizations have received increasing attention in recent years as an emerging organizational form to integrate diverse and specialized intellectual resources and expertise. These organizations can circumvent traditional barriers to organizational change and innovation, since each project is presented as a temporary, relatively short-lived, phenomenon. Because of their limited duration, project-based organizations do not constitute irreversible resource commitments of fixed costs. Hence, companies and other types of organization may launch a variety of ventures through project-based organizations and may terminate unsuccessful ventures at low cost and little disturbance to the organizational sponsor. For many of these industries, project-based organizations are employed to meet the highly differentiated and customized nature of demand, where clients frequently negotiate and interact with project organizers over the often-innovative design of products and services.},

This paper sets out to question this tendency to equate projects and innovation which, in our view, can lead to the improper use of projects to manage innovation. We argue that, in line with the work on project classification, a distinction should be made between the various types of design situations to which different types of projects are suited. Qualitative research on automotive telematics allows us to identify the management methods suited to the most innovative projects, i.e. exploration projects for which neither technologies nor customer requirements are known at the start of the project. We will show how these situations shake up traditional project management models and will propose five management principles adapted to this new situation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.},

As a result, the creative activity must be considered as embedded in creative territories. In other words, these creative milieus should be considered as specific innovative clusters that allow for the creative process to be fully expressed. Following this perspective, we argue that the dynamics of creativity lie in the interaction between three different layers of a territory: the underground, the middleground and the upperground. In order to illustrate this point of view, we propose to analyse the birth of two distinct musical styles that are both directly related to the places in which they emerged: soul music in Detroit and rap music in New York.},

Research on radical innovation management, while recognizing the success of GTs, generally describes their design according to evolutionary strategies featuring multiple and uncertain trials, which would finally result in the discovery of common features between multiple applications. Building on a case study conducted on two technological development programs at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), we exhibit an anomaly to this rarely discussed idea: we describe an alternative strategy that consists in intentionally designing common features that bridge the gap between a priori heterogeneous applications and a priori heterogeneous technologies. This anomaly brings three main results: 1) The usual trial-and-learning strategy is not necessarily the only strategy to design a GT; 2) beyond technological breakthrough, the value of GTs also relies on the capacity to reuse and connect existing technologies; 3) the design of GT might require sophisticated organizational patterns to be able to involve multiple technology suppliers and applications' providers.},

These are issues at the core of the management of innovation literature, and the challenge of how to answer these questions in real time remains a problem yet to be solved, particularly in cases where innovation is highly expected. Most path-dependence studies observe the degree of "innovativeness" in novelty creation and analyze path-dependence and path-creation phenomena after the fact, relegating the actors to grasping at the lessons learned rather than providing them with a real-time diagnosis of their specific situation. However, in some lock-in situations where the demand for innovation is high - we label these as orphan innovation situations - characterizing the paths that are potential candidates for path-creation can be critical for the development of the industrial sector. With the goal of assessing path-dependence in real time, we develop a framework to visualize three types of innovation pathways (those explored, those not explored but visible in the present innovation field, and those potential pathways that are unknown in the present innovation field). Using C-K design theory as a conceptual framework, we go further and apply this framework to two case studies to explore its utility as a reference for assessing the degree of innovativeness for a field of innovation. We then explore the framework's potential to provide strategic intelligence to break out of stagnant situations.},

We analyze the case of the experimentation of the ?Always Playable? project at Ubisoft Montreal, a leading video game development studio, where a crisis of creativity triggered an active reconfiguration of routines and their artifacts. To address this crisis, the organization attempted to restore a balance between efficiency and flexibility by modifying the generative relationship among the ostensive aspect, the performative aspect, and artifacts of routines. Our study shows that one way to reach this balance is by deliberately breaking, partitioning, and recombining aspects from different routines.},

A thing or system that is easily harmed by randomness is fragile. We argue that, contrary to their appearance, big capital investments break easily - i.e. deliver negative net present value - due to various sources of uncertainty that impact them during their long gestation, implementation, and operation periods. We do not refute the existence of economies of scale and scope. Instead we argue that big capital investments have a disproportionate (non-linear) exposure to uncertainties that deliver poor or negative returns above and beyond their economies of scale and scope. We further argue that to succeed, leaders of capital projects need to carefully consider where scaling pays off and where it does not. To automatically assume that "bigger is better," which is common in megaproject management, is a recipe for failure.},

abstract = {Research on organizational paradoxes, notably the learning/performing paradox, have demonstrated the potential value of a detailed analysis of tensions resulting from the need to develop future capabilities, while simultaneously guaranteeing success in the present. But analyzing this paradox exclusively from the perspective of the antagonism between exploration and exploitation masks tensions of a different nature linked to phenomena concerning the transmission, extension and replication of existing capabilities. In this article we apply a concept deriving from the field of project management, namely exploitative learning, which provides a broader appreciation of the diversity of learning processes located in the grey area between exploration and exploitation. Empirically, we will focus on the study of tensions between exploitative learning and performing perceived by the actors in an industrial infrastructure engineering unit simultaneously developing a number of different projects and taking on new recruits. It transpires that learning processes associated with the development of teams for new projects and the training of numerous recruits can, at the macro- and microstructural levels, run counter to short-term logics of performance, thereby threatening the development of future capabilities. Our study makes it possible to broaden the terms by which the learning/performing paradox is defined. It also enriches our understanding of exploitative learning situations by demonstrating that they require both an allocation in terms of human resources and an investment in terms of time, approaches that are hard to reconcile with short-term goals.},

Converging evidence in cognitive psychology has indicated that the ability to generate original ideas can be limited by recently activated knowledge, such as examples of solutions. On the other hand, neuroimaging studies have recently demonstrated that exposure to examples could, on the contrary, have a stimulating effect on originality. To make sense of what seems to be contradictory studies, we hypothesized that two types of examples could have opposite effects on originality: (1) restrictive examples—within the fixation effect—could lead to a reduction in the originality of the solutions, whereas (2) expansive examples—outside the fixation effect—could provoke solutions of higher originality. Results from a total of 160 participants confirmed that the solutions proposed by the group exposed to restrictive examples were less original than those given by the group exposed to expansive examples.},

The framework is based on the concept of transilience - the capacity of an innovation to influence the established systems of production and marketing. Application of the concept results in a categorization of innovation into four types. Examples from the technical history of the US auto industry are used to illustrate the concepts and their applicability. The analysis shows that the categories of innovation are closely linked to different patterns of evolution and to different managerial environments. Special emphasis is placed on the role of incremental technical change in shaping competition and on the possibilities for a technology based reversal in the process of industrial maturity. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

Studies have shown that idea impulses which emerge from less experienced users turned out to be more original. This paper seeks to improve and conceptualize the understanding of collaboration with even more distant users at the boundaries of markets in the context of exploration for discontinuous innovation. Commonalities of different terms coined throughout the innovation management literature, such as potential or emerging users, are identified and a comprehensive definition is derived. The merits expected to arise from collaboration with these users, identified from a comprehensive literature review, are aligned to literature on the degree of innovativeness and theories from creativity research. Instead of solely classifying individuals according to the dichotomy between either being a current user or a non-user, the notion of use experience, user knowledge and domain involvement will be applied to allow for a more fine grained and individually based classification of users. Finally, significant research gaps in the collaboration with potential users are drawn out which call for researchers' attention in order to mitigate the struggles of organizations in explorative activities towards discontinuity.},

abstract = {A common justification for organizational change is that the circumstances in which the organization finds itself have changed, thereby eroding the value of utilizing existing knowledge. On the surface, the claim that organizations should adapt by generating new knowledge seems obvious and compelling. However, this standard wisdom overlooks the possibility that the reward to generating new knowledge may itself be eroded if change is an ongoing property of the environment. This observation in turn suggests that environmental change is not a self-evident call for strategies of greater exploration. Indeed, under some conditions the appropriate response to environmental change is a renewed focus on exploiting existing knowledge and opportunities. We develop a computational model based on the canonical multiarmed bandit formulation of exploration and exploitation. We endeavor to understand the mechanisms by which environmental change acts to make purposeful efforts at organizational adaptation less (or more) valuable.},

abstract = {Mainstream organizational research is based on science and the humanities. Science helps us to understand organized systems, from an outsider position, as empirical objects. The humanities contribute to understanding, and critically reflect- ing on, the human experience of actors inside organized practices. This paper argues that, in view of the persistent relevance gap between theory and practice, organization studies should be b{\textless}roadened to include design as one of its primary modes of engaging in research. Design is characterized by its emphasis on solution finding, guided by broader purposes and ideal target systems. Moreover, design develops, and draws on, design propositions that are tested in pragmatic experiments and grounded in organization science. This study first explores the main differences and synergies between science and design, and explores how and why the design discipline has largely moved away from academia to other sites in the economy. The argument then turns to the genealogy of design methodologies in organization and management studies. Subsequently, this paper explores the circular design methodology that serves to illustrate the nature of design research, that is, the pragmatic focus on actionable knowledge as well as the key role of ideal target systems in design processes. Finally, the author proposes a framework for communication and collaboration between the science and design modes, and argues that scholars in organization studies can guide human beings in the process of designing and developing their organizations toward more humane, participative, and productive futures. In this respect, the organization discipline can make a difference.},

Although much research focuses on new innovation R{\&}D, little research exists regarding the role that R{\&}D plays in a firm's learning aptitude. A theoretical model is developed to examine implications of this dual role of research for R{\&}D investment using the basic sources of technological knowledge a firm uses: such as the firm's own R{\&}D, knowledge originating with its competitors' R{\&}D spillovers, and knowledge created outside the industry. The model is tested using survey data on technological opportunity and appropriability conditions from Levin, et al. (1983, 1987) and data on business unit R{\&}D expenditures from the Federal Trade Commission's Line of Business Programme. Results demonstrate that the influence of both appropriability and technical opportunity conditions are affected by determinants of the ease of learning, particularly the targeted quality of knowledge inputs. This suggests that the characteristics of knowledge that affect the ease of firm learning may represent an important class of determinants of R{\&}D investments.},

In Design-Driven Innovation: How to Compete by Radically Innovating the Meaning of Products, Roberto Verganti introduces a third strategy, a radical shift in perspective that introduces a bold new way of competing. Design-driven innovations do not come from the market; they create new markets. They don't push new technologies; they push new meanings. It's about having a vision, and taking that vision to your customers. Think of game-changers like Nintendo's Wii or Apple's iPod. They overturned our understanding of what a video game means and how we listen to music. Customers had not asked for these new meanings, but once they experienced them, it was love at first sight. But where does the vision come from? With fascinating examples from leading European and American companies, Verganti shows that for truly breakthrough products and services, we must look beyond customers and users to those he calls "interpreters" - the experts who deeply understand and shape the markets they work in. Design-Driven Innovation offers a provocative new view of innovation thinking and practice.},

Among the foundations, the manager is considered following axioms describing his rationality; the most prominent ones being transitivity and independence. The order in preferences is not supposed be reversed yet unknown events of nature may perturb our understanding and may require designing new decisions going against decision theories, hence increasing uncertainty. In this paper we propose a model of decision making in the unknown whose hypotheses are tested on an industrial case in order to show that traditional decision making is not able to grasp the natural phenomenon of expansion and generativity as a manager senses the unknown in an innovation project. Bayesian Nets with Abraham Wald's foundations are used to sense the re-ordering preferences and the benefits of designing one's playground and being intransitive. The purpose is also to contribute to the idea that design theories, theories studying generative processes, by opposition to optimisation (decision theory) and ideation (creativity theory) can help extend the underlying logic of innovation management.},

@article{Lumineau2016,
abstract = {(2016) propose augmenting the microfoundations of transaction cost economics (TCE) through enriching the bounded rationality concept. They argue that psychological frames and biases, when linked to different hierarchical forms, may give rise to differential costly conflicts. In their view, such conflicts are entirely rooted in bounded ratio-nality, as opposed to opportunism. Foss and Weber's (2016) piece on revisiting TCE's microfoundations should be welcomed for two reasons. First, many scholars have credibly criti-cized the Williamsonian opportunism assumption for several decades but have not made much progress in providing an alternative. Second, giv-ing more substance to the bounded rationality as-sumption can make the concept more actionable for researchers and practicing managers. An extended bounded rationality concept could po-tentially contribute to extending the quality of TCE-based reasoning. The authors suggest doing so by co-opting insights from applied psychology in the form of frames and biases. However, in this Dialogue piece we raise three additional issues, which somewhat challenge Foss and Weber's perspective on how to extend TCE, and we sug-gest an alternative path forward, thereby indeed giving opportunism " the proper back seat. " A first important point to make is that TCE thinking encompasses much more than the Wil-liamsonian version, although Williamson has obviously been its most successful student. In the international management sphere, modern in-ternalization theory, as exemplified by the early work of Buckley and Casson (1976) and Rugman (1981), has usefully put forward a theory of the multinational enterprise (MNE), building on Coa-sean insights. In Rugman's version, the MNE is actually the unit of analysis, and its purported greatest challenge is how it can protect its pro-prietary knowledge when expanding abroad. Here the main microfoundation used is bounded ratio-nality, without much—if any—focus on opportunism. For example, when self-interested (nonoppor-tunistic) individuals contemplate a licensing agreement, the ex ante disclosure of information as a public good by a licensor to a potential li-censee may ultimately lead to rent dissipation experienced by the former. As a result of the knowledge disclosure process, the potential li-censee can learn valuable elements that may affect his or her future strategy, with the knowl-edge learned affecting the licensor's competitive position. As another example, MNEs may set up subsidiaries abroad, largely based on their supe-rior capacity to transfer, deploy, and exploit their knowledge within the context of a hierarchy, rather than based on market contracts.},

Organisms face these types of choices quite frequently, from natural history tradeoffs to foraging decisions, mate choice, parental investment, and cooperative dilemmas. The ever-present nature of intertemporal choices makes them of interest to a broad range of disciplines. The economic perspective generates models of optimal temporal tradeoffs. The psychological perspective explores the cognitive mechanisms used in intertemporal choice. The evolutionary perspective investigates the adaptive value of trading off present and future benefits.

We use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a sample of expert decision makers to make two main contributions. First, we identify and contrast the specific brain regions and cognitive processes associated with exploitation and exploration decisions. Exploitation activates regions associated with reward seeking, which track and evaluate the value of current choices, while exploration relies on regions associated with attentional control, tracking the value of alternative choices. Second, we propose and test the idea that stronger activation of the brain circuits related to attentional control allows individuals to achieve better decision‐making performance as a result. We discuss the implications of these results for strategic management research and practice.},

Both serve their own purpose, but entail different sets of values. This is particularly true in relation to the contribution of project management to organisational performance. The competing values framework has been used to highlight different sets of values and preferences underlying the evaluation of PMO performance and emphasizes the competing aspect. The research adopted a participatory action research approach in a university hospital where a major organisational transformation is taking place. Findings reveal the existence of paradoxes between the executives and the PMO regarding the PMO performance and show how these paradoxes evolved over time. This sheds light not only on the paradoxes, but also on the dynamic process related to performance evaluation within a transformation project. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd and International Project Management Association.},

In 2011, this project was established in a new company. By using primary and secondary data, we describe the resources a business developer managed to access through his personal and professional network between 2006 and 2014 and the obstacles that hampered his efforts. We demonstrate that the business developer's personal network was useful in acquiring new ideas and getting people involved in the project. However, the MNC may have prevented the business developer from developing a network adequate to secure financing for the project.},

Weaving together lessons from such international leaders as Siemens, Unilever, Skandia, and Sony, along with their own first-hand consulting experiences, the authors introduce knowledge enabling - the overall set of organizational activities that promote knowledge creation - and demonstrate its power to transform an organization's knowledge into value-creating actions. They describe the five key "knowledge enablers" and outline what it takes to instill a knowledge vision, manage conversations, mobilize knowledge activists, create the right context for knowledge creation, and globalize local knowledge. The authors stress that knowledge creation must be more than the exclusive purview of one individual - or designated "knowledge" officer. Indeed, it demands new roles and responsibilities for everyone in the organization - from the elite in the executive suite to the frontline workers on the shop floor. Whether an activist, a caring expert, or a corporate epistemologist who focuses on the theory of knowledge itself, everyone in an organization has a vital role to play in making "care" an integral part of the everyday experience; in supporting, nurturing, and encouraging microcommunities of innovation and fun; and in creating a shared space where knowledge is created, exchanged, and used for sustained, competitive advantage.

abstract = {This book presents linkography, a method for the notation and analysis of the design process. Developed by Gabriela Goldschmidt in an attempt to clarify designing, linkography documents how designers think, generate ideas, put them to the test, and combine them into something meaningful. With linkography, Goldschmidt shows that there is a logic to the creative process—that it is not, as is often supposed, pure magic. Linkography draws on design practice, protocol analysis, and insights from cognitive psychology. Goldschmidt argues that the generation of ideas (and their inspection and adjustment) evolves over a large number of small steps, which she terms design moves. These combine in a network of moves, and the patterns of links in the networks manifest a “good fit,” or congruence, among the ideas. Goldschmidt explains what parts of the design process can be observed and measured in a linkograph, describing its features and notation conventions. The most significant elements in a linkograph are critical moves, which are particularly rich in links. Goldschmidt presents studies that show the importance of critical moves in design thinking; describes cases that demonstrate linkography's effectiveness in studying the creative process in design (focusing on the good fit); and offers thirteen linkographic studies conducted by other researchers that show the potential of linkography in design thinking research and beyond. Linkography is the first book-length treatment of an approach to design thinking that has already proved influential in the field.},

However, little is known about the potential impact of a specific positive or negative emotional context on this bias. We investigated this question with adult participants using an emotional priming paradigm. First, participants were presented with positive or negative affective pictures (i.e., pleasant vs. unpleasant photographs). Afterward, participants had to perform a financial decision-making task that was unrelated to the pictures previously presented. The results revealed that the presentation framed in terms of gain or loss no longer affected subjects' decision-making following specific exposure to emotionally pleasant pictures. Interestingly, a positive emotional context did not globally influence risk-taking behavior but specifically decreased the risk propensity in the loss frame. This finding confirmed that a positive emotional context can reduce loss aversion, and it strongly reinforced the dual-process view that the framing effect stems from an affective heuristic belonging to intuitive System 1.},

Charles Scribner's Sons, New York), the effectiveness of brainstorming has been widely debated. While some researchers and practitioners consider it the standard idea generation and problem-solving method in organizations, part of the social science literature has argued in favor of nominal groups, i.e., the same number of individuals generating solutions in isolation. In this paper, we revisit this debate, and we explore the implications that the underlying problem structure and the team diversity have on the quality of the best solution as obtained by the different group configurations. We build on the normative search literature of new product development, and we show that no group configuration dominates. Therefore, nominal groups perform better in specialized problems, even when the factors that affect the solution quality exhibit complex interactions (problem complexity). In cross-functional problems, the brainstorming group exploits the competence diversity of its participants to attain better solutions. However, their advantage vanishes for extremely complex problems.},

But all these strategies limit the development of design in an organization, though they may be steps toward the fifth approach to managing design. This fifth approach, though less tangible and more difficult to realize, is more effective, they argue. They call it design by infusion or “silent design.” The intent is to have everyone in the firm concerned with design all the time, because that's the way they always do business.

abstract = {Innovation is rapidly becoming democratized. Users, aided by improvements in computer and communications technology, increasingly can develop their own new products and services. These innovating users - both individuals and firms - often freely share their innovations with others, creating user-innovation communities and a rich intellectual commons. In Democratizing Innovation I look closely at this emerging user-centered innovation system, which is affecting both information products and physical products.   Drawing on work done with several coauthors, I explore why and when users find it profitable to develop new products and services for themselves, and why it often pays users to reveal their innovations freely for the use of all. Drawing on work with Nikolaus Franke, Pam Morrison and others, I document that product and service development is concentrated among lead user firms and individuals. Lead users that are ahead on marketplace trends do not replicate manufacturer development efforts.   Instead, they develop products that are not yet available. Later manufacturers find many of these user-developed products to be the basis for commercial products. Drawing upon work with Dietmar Harhoff, Joachim Henkel and others, I report that user innovation has a positive impact on social welfare, and propose that government policies, including R{\&}D subsidies and tax credits, should be realigned to eliminate biases against it.},

abstract = {In this paper we question the one‐sided thesis that contemporary organizations rely on the mobilization of cognitive capacities. We suggest that severe restrictions on these capacities in the form of what we call functional stupidity are an equally important if under‐recognized part of organizational life. Functional stupidity refers to an absence of reflexivity, a refusal to use intellectual capacities in other than myopic ways, and avoidance of justifications. We argue that functional stupidity is prevalent in contexts dominated by economy in persuasion which emphasizes image and symbolic manipulation. This gives rise to forms of stupidity management that repress or marginalize doubt and block communicative action. In turn, this structures individuals' internal conversations in ways that emphasize positive and coherent narratives and marginalize more negative or ambiguous ones. This can have productive outcomes such as providing a degree of certainty for individuals and organizations. But it can have corrosive consequences such as creating a sense of dissonance among individuals and the organization as a whole. The positive consequences can give rise to self‐reinforcing stupidity. The negative consequences can spark dialogue, which may undermine functional stupidity.},

abstract = {Traditional approaches to studying competitive advantage, while valuable, are not adequate to explain how firms can operate effectively in turbulent and often chaotic environments. A resource or skill-based view focusing on development and application of core competences is offered to supplement the traditional approaches. We present a model of the development and outcomes of dynamic core competences based on organizational meta-learning. A firm's core competence(s) is defined as a set of problem-defining and problem-solving insights that fosters the development of idiosyncratic strategic growth alternatives. Dynamic core competences are based on the integration into systemic meta-learning of universal and tacit knowledge through information transfer, redefinition of heuristics and continuous improvement based on experimentation and the development of firm-specific skills based on dynamic routines. Dynamic core competences can be leveraged to create growth alternatives of global diversification, new applications of existing technologies and/or the development of new lines of business. Finally, dynamic core competences can be used to reduce uncertainty and to induce path dependencies that create causal ambiguity (making imitation from other firms difficult). In so doing, they can form the basis of competitive advantages. {\textcopyright} 1996 JAI Press Inc. All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.},

Organizations are seen as learning by encoding inferences from history into routines that guide behavior. Within this perspective on organizational learning, topics covered include how organizations learn from direct experience, how organizations learn from the experience of others, and how organizations develop conceptual frameworks or paradigms for interpreting that experience. The section on organizational memory discusses how organizations encode, store, and retrieve the lessons of history despite the turnover of personnel and the passage of time. Organizational learning is further complicated by the ecological structure of the simultaneously adapting behavior of other organizations, and by an endogenously changing environment. The final section discusses the limitations as well as the possibilities of organizational learning as a form of intelligence.},

abstract = {The mirroring hypothesis predicts that the organizational patterns of a development project (e.g. communication links, geographic collocation, team and firm co-membership) will correspond to the technical patterns of dependency in the system under development. Scholars in a range of disciplines have argued that mirroring is either necessary or a highly desirable feature of development projects, but evidence pertaining to the hypothesis is widely scattered across fields, research sites, and methodologies. In this paper, we formally define the mirroring hypothesis and review 102 empirical studies spanning three levels of organization: within a single firm, across firms, and in open community-based development projects. The hypothesis was supported in 69{\%} of the cases. Support for the hypothesis was strongest in the within-firm sample, less strong in the across-firm sample, and relatively weak in the open collaborative sample. Based on a detailed analysis of the cases in which the mirroring hypothesis was not supported, we introduce the concept of actionable transparency as a means of achieving coordination without mirroring. We present examples from practice and describe the more complex organizational patterns that emerge when actionable transparency allows designers to ‘break the mirror.'},

abstract = {In contrast with the relative stability of interdepartmental coordination mechanisms in ongoing operations, coordination tasks and mechanisms typically change over the course of the product development project's life cycle. This article presents a taxonomy of these project coordination mechanisms. The taxonomy is based on an inductive analysis of development projects in nine printed circuit board operations and four aircraft hydraulic tubing operations. It distinguishes four modes of interdepartmental interaction—standards, schedules, mutual adaptation and teams (as in Thompson [Thompson, J. D. 1967. Organizations in Action. McGraw-Hill, New York.] and Van de Ven et al. [Van de Ven, A. H., A. L. Delbecq, R. Koenig, Jr. 1976. Determinants of coordination modes within organizations. Amer. Sociological Rev.41322–338.])—in each of three temporal phases: pre-project, product and process design, and manufacturing. Each of the resulting twelve matrix cells represents a distinct coordination mechanism. Since the objective of coordinating design and manufacturing departments is to ensure an acceptable fit between product design and manufacturing process parameters, the most efficient interdepartmental coordination mechanism is that which is able to deal with the uncertainty of this product/process fit at least cost to the organization. Extending Perrow's (Perrow, C. 1967. A framework for the comparative analysis of organizations. Amer. Sociological Rev.32 194–208.) analysis of the two dimensions of uncertainty to the case of product/process fit, the choice of interaction mode within each project phase is hypothesized to depend on the novelty of the product/process fit problem, and the relative importance of coordination effort across the three project phases is hypothesized to depend on the analyzability of the product/process fit problem.},

abstract = {Program management has taken its position in project management research and in public and private organizations as a successful method for managing complex, uncertain, and large-scale changes. During the past 25 years, research has evolved from programs as the conceptual extension of projects to a rich field of empirical studies reflecting the special natures and contexts of change programs and their management, with unique theoretical foundations. To take stock of this recent history, in this article we analyze the patterns of previous empirical studies on change program management and their theoretical foundations. The goal is to identify and summarize proposals to guide forthcoming program management research. The results reveal three main themes of ongoing research: managing over the change program lifecycle, managing programs in their context, and program managers' capabilities. The roots of change program management in organization theories are apparent; structural contingency theory and information processing theories have dominated in previous empirical research, but are clearly being extended to agency, stakeholder, and actor-network theories. New research ideas are proposed for the use of programs in various types of changes, value creation and delivery through change programs, the profiles and capabilities of different actors in program management, the coexistence and interplay of multiple programs, and the complex stakeholder networks involved with change programs. When change becomes more prevalent in the organizations' dynamic contexts, there is an increasing need to develop program management toward an organizational capability for managing value-oriented, integrated, and multi-project change in complex stakeholder contexts.},

This balanced view is embedded in the concept of ambidextrous organizations. However, there is little direct evidence of the positive effect of ambidexterity on firm performance. This paper seeks to test the ambidexterity hypothesis by examining how exploration and exploitation can jointly influence firm performance in the context of firms' approach to technological innovation. Based on a sample of 206 manufacturing firms, we find evidence consistent with the ambidexterity hypothesis by showing that (1) the interaction between explorative and exploitative innovation strategies is positively related to sales growth rate, and (2) the relative imbalance between explorative and exploitative innovation strategies is negatively related to sales growth rate.},

abstract = {Organizational learning has many virtues, virtues which recent writings in strategic management have highlighted. Learning processes, however, are subject to some important limitations. As is well-known, learning has to cope with confusing experience and the complicated problem of balancing the competing goals of developing new knowledge (i.e., exploring) and exploiting current competencies in the face of dynamic tendencies to emphasize one or the other. We examine the ways organizations approach these problems through simplification and specialization and how those approaches contribute to three forms of learning myopia, the tendency to overlook distant times, distant places, and failures, and we identify some ways in which organizations sustain exploration in the face of a tendency to overinvest in exploitation.

These violations of EU predictions were largely disregarded until the late 1970s, when a variety of alternatives to, and generalizations of, EU theory began to appear, most notably prospect theory of Kahneman and Tversky. Dozens of generalized EU models appeared in the 1980s and early 1990s. Of these, the most prominent classes were rank-dependent models, betweenness models and regret-theoretic approaches.},

abstract = {Globalization has transformed the international business environment into an increasingly more complex, uncertain, and diverse entity. Multinational enterprises are under greater pressure to develop their dynamic capabilities to not only adapt to, but also proactively cope with, the speed and complexities of the fast-changing environment. Some research suggests that dynamic capabilities are closely correlated with top management functions, while counterarguments stress that dynamic capabilities are embedded in organizational activities. From the perspective of organizational knowledge creation, making a distinction between the creative and adaptive aspects of dynamic capabilities, this article argues that creative' dynamic capabilities are rooted in the activities of teams in middle levels of the organization. The article also presents leadership practices that are favorable to fostering dynamic capabilities. Technical summaryThis article examines the theoretical foundations of an organization's dynamic capabilitiessensing, seizing, and transformingfrom the perspective of organizational knowledge creation. Making a distinction between the creative and adaptive aspects of dynamic capabilities, this article argues that the foundation of creative aspect is meso:' it stems from team-level interactions of frontline workers' capabilities facilitated by middle managers, rather than from individual-level (or micro-level) capabilities. In this middle-up-down management model, top management sets the vision of the organization, but middle managers grasp and solve the gap between the top and the frontline by facilitating team-level dialectic interactions of employees. The leadership practices of both top and middle management that facilitate this process are illustrated with four Japanese multinational companiesFujifilm, Eisai, Mayekawa Manufacturing, and Toyota.

This paper aims to describe how the SAP Design Services Team uses design thinking and its principles to improve the organization's ability improve its ability to execute strategy and even evolve the way SAP identifies and defines its strategic vision. Design/methodology/approach – This paper examines both the value of the design thinking approach as well as the organizational practices employed to insure its success. Findings – The study has found a number of best practices for the development of artifacts to make strategies tangible, as well as the organizational requirements for the wide spread adoption of design thinking as an approach for the entire organization. Applying the principles of design thinking the Design Services Team has developed the means to analyze, refine and convey business strategies in the form of artifacts or prototypes. While demonstrating what the final offering will be from a customer's point of view, these objects also express the strategic planning as well as external market forces and risks within their narrative. Going beyond traditional communication channels this approach not only expresses the vision and intent behind the strategy but also an eventual end‐state; in short this method allows everyone across the organization to understand the real meaning of your strategy by knowing what success will look like when its achieved. Originality/value – By reexamining both how they identify and develop their strategies as well as how those strategies are communicated and refined in implementation, organizations can increase their effectiveness and decrease time to execution. Today most strategies are conveyed as broad visions that lack any specifics regarding how the goals are to be achieved allowing it to be disintegrated at the point of execution. Combining the aspirational message with tangible examples of the end‐state makes the message and the mission clear and actionable.},

This implies a clear definition of mission and system are given at the outset (to reduce uncertainty), and subsequent execution in phases with decision gates. It contrasts with the approach applied in the seminal projects that are credited with establishing the foundation of the discipline in the 1940s and 1950s. Those projects started out with missions that were beyond the currently possible; any solutions had to emerge over time. They succeeded by a combination of parallel trials (from which the best would then be selected) and trial-and-error iteration (allowing for the modification of solutions pursued over a period of time). Although the success of these approaches was well documented and explained by scientific study in the 1950s, today they seem to fly in the face of accepted professional standards, making managers uncomfortable when they are encountered.

We substantiate this insight with 82-day ethnography of a dramatic television series production as it unfolded in real-time. Our analyses reveal three distinct practices enacted by project members to (re)balance creativity within the parameters of the project: 1) analogically linking controls with creative tasks; 2) (in)formally attuning creative tasks to controls as the project unfolds; and 3) (re)allocating scarce resources to realize creative aspirations of the project. Taken together, these practices organically but predictably (re)balance creativity and control in large scale projects. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

We label this capability a firm's absorptive capacity and suggest that it is largely a function of the firm's level of prior related knowledge. The discussion focuses first on the cognitive basis for an individual's absorptive capacity including, in particular, prior related knowledge and diversity of background. We then characterize the factors that influence absorptive capacity at the organizational level, how an organization's absorptive capacity differs from that of its individual members, and the role of diversity of expertise within an organization. We argue that the development of absorptive capacity, and, in turn, innovative performance are history- or path-dependent and argue how lack of investment in an area of expertise early on may foreclose the future development of a technical capability in that area. We formulate a model of firm investment in research and development (R{\&}D), in which R{\&}D contributes to a firm's absorptive capacity, and test predictions relating a firm's investment in R{\&}D to the knowledge underlying technical change within an industry. Discussion focuses on the implications of absorptive capacity for the analysis of other related innovative activities, including basic research, the adoption and diffusion of innovations, and decisions to participate in cooperative R{\&}D ventures.},

Companies are increasingly realizing that the old, sequential approach to developing new products simply won't get the job done. Instead, companies in Japan and the United States are using a holistic method--as in rugby, the ball gets passed within the team as it moves as a unit up the field. This holistic approach has six characteristics: built-in instability, self-organizing project teams, overlapping development phases, "multilearning," subtle control, and organizational transfer of learning. The six pieces fit together like a jigsaw puzzle, forming a fast and flexible process for new product development. Just as important, the new approach can act as a change agent: it is a vehicle for introducing creative, market-driven ideas and processes into an old, rigid organization. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},

abstract = {Studies on clinical inference show that people do not always improve their judgments with experience. This paper argues that the expectation that they will improve is mistaken and founded on an incorrect conception of the nature of experience. Changing this conception towards a more adequate one along the lines suggested by Popper (1963) leads to a far more pessimistic view about people's ability to learn from experience, a view that is in closer corrrespondence with the facts from studies on clinical judgement. The paper also reviews results from psychological studies concerned with people's ability to learn from experience in probabilistic situations. These studies show that people have a number of biases which prevent them from using the information which experience provides. Examples of such biases are the tendency to use confirmatory evidence, assumptions about causality, and disregard of negative information. The paper argues that these biases can be understood in terms of the kind of information that people actually have to use when learning from experience outside the laboratory. {\textcopyright} 1980, All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper examines the nature of the core capabilities of a firm, focusing in particular on their interaction with new product and process development projects. Two new concepts about core capabilities are explored here. First, while core capabilities are traditionally treated as clusters of distinct technical systems, skills, and managerial systems, these dimensions of capabilities are deeply rooted in values, which constitute an often overlooked but critical fourth dimension. Second, traditional core capabilities have a down side that inhibits innovation, here called core rigidities. Managers of new product and process development projects thus face a paradox: how to take advantage of core capabilities without being hampered by their dysfunctional Pip side. Such projects play an important role in emerging strategies by highlighting the need for change and leading the way. Twenty case studies of new product and process development projects in five firms provide illustrative data.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Strategically important projects involve high stakes, uncertainty, and stakeholder complexity, with contingencies and risks typically surfacing repeatedly as the project evolves. This is challenging not only for the project team (PT) but also in particular for the steering committee (SC), the top management oversight structure typically used to align a project with the organization's strategic goals. This article explores how senior executives on SCs can exercise leadership and effective oversight of strategic projects, although they have only limited time and often incomplete expertise. The SC can keep a project aligned, even with limited time, through focused understanding of the key logic and drivers of the project. The SC needs to manage the surprises and crises that inevitably arise in a difficult project through proactive analysis that goes to the bottom of the problem and by working with the PT to generate solutions. KeYwoRDS: strategic projects, project supervision and oversight, project governance, steering committee work, focused understanding, managing surprises M any senior executives are frustrated with how difficult it is to influence important projects in their organization, whether in order to align them better with strategy, manage risk levels, get ailing projects back on track, or even get valid informa-tion on them in the first place. 1 Executives on project steering committees (SCs) sometimes describe themselves as hostages, overwhelmed by myriad opaque technical issues and by the difficulty of really understanding what is going on.},

abstract = {The goal of our research1 was to understand what is expected today from a design theory and what types of impact such type of scientific proposition may reach. To answer these questions with a grounded approach we chosed to study the developement of C-K theory as phenomenon per se that can inform our research work. C-K theory is clearly recognized as a design theory and it is a good representative of the level of generality and abstraction of contemporary design theory. Indeed, the validity of the theory as such has already been documented (e.g. Hatchuel {\&} Weil 2002, 2003, 2008, 2009; Kazakçi 2009; Reich et al 2010; Le Masson et al 2010; Ullah et al 2012). Instead the current work sets out to understand the dissemination and the impact of the theory in both academic and industrial fields. The data collection overlooks the literature on C-K theory in English and in French, and includes interviews and feedbacks of students and industrial partners who applied C-K methodologies and tools. This research confirms the rapid diffusion and multiples impact of C-K theory. Beyond, such study signals that there are important expectations and potential impacts of a Design Theory within the field of knowledge at large. However there are strong conditions to meet these expectations: generality, generativity, and relatedness to contemporary sciences. A similar research could be done on Nam Suh's axiomatic approach to further test these conditions. It is impossible to say what will be the next generations of Design theory but it is sure that they should progress on these directions.},

abstract = {Bayesian rationality is the paradigm of rational behavior in neoclassical economics. An economic agent is deemed rational when she maximizes her subjective expected utility and consistently revises her beliefs according to Bayes's rule. The paper raises the question of how, when and why this characterization of rationality came to be endorsed by mainstream economists. Though no definitive answer is provided, it is argued that the question is of great historiographic importance. The story begins with Abraham Wald's behaviorist approach to statistics and culminates with Leonard J. Savage's elaboration of subjective expected utility theory in his 1954 classic The Foundations of Statistics. The latter's acknowledged fiasco to achieve a reinterpretation of traditional inference techniques along subjectivist and behaviorist lines raises the puzzle of how a failed project in statistics could turn into such a big success in economics. Possible answers call into play the emphasis on consistency requirements in neoclassical theory and the impact of the postwar transformation of U.S. business schools.},

From how science is funded, to improving how children are educated -- and nearly everything in-between -- our society has become obsessed with a seductive illusion: that greatness results from doggedly measuring improvement in the relentless pursuit of an ambitious goal.

They make the case that great achievement can't be bottled up into mechanical metrics; that innovation is not driven by narrowly focused heroic effort; and that we would be wiser (and the outcomes better) if instead we whole-heartedly embraced serendipitous discovery and playful creativity. Controversial at its heart, yet refreshingly provocative, this book challenges readers to consider life without a destination and discovery without a compass.},

We often suspect that it affects us with partial and indefinite evidence that it exists but we only have uncertain feelings about it. Even when we do not know what it is we would like to allow for its influence in our explaining the outcome of a decision. One way to deal with the many factors of a decision is to include the unknown as one of them and then determine its priority of influence on the outcome by comparing it with other factors. We are able to do that to the extent that we are sure of what we know and of the residual that remains outside our understanding that may also have some effect on what we do. Confidence from good understanding and past success are what we need in order to judge the potential significance of what we do not know on the outcome. We can then perform sensitivity analysis to see how much effect unknown factors can have on the stability of the choice we make. Pairwise comparisons make it possible to tackle this idea explicitly and rather simply. This note illustrates how to prioritize and test the effect of the unknown alongside the known. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {C-K theory is a unified Design theory and was first introduced in 2003 (Hatchuel and Weil 2003). The name "C-K theory" reflects the assumption that Design can be modelled as the interplay between two interdependent spaces with different structures and logics: the space of concepts (C) and the space of knowledge (K). Both pragmatic views of Design and existing Design theories define Design as a dynamic mapping process between required functions and selected structures. However, dynamic mapping is not sufficient to describe the generation of new objects and new knowledge which are distinctive features of Design. We show that C-K theory captures such generation and offers a rigorous definition of Design. This is illustrated with an example: the design of Magnesium-CO(2) engines for Mars explorations. Using C-K theory we also discuss Braha and Reich's topological structures for design modelling (Braha and Reich 2003). We interpret this approach as special assumptions about the stability of objects in space K. Combining C-K theory and Braha and Reich's models opens new areas for research about knowledge structures in Design theories. These findings confirm the analytical and interpretative power of C-K theory.},

Yet there are a number of challenges to this axiom: research on matrix organisation, the embeddedness of projects in project ecologies, and projectification all emphasise the relationship of the project to permanent organisations. Similarly, research on project-based firms and owner organisations which are relatively permanent challenges this axiom. This paper develops a conceptual framework which defines three domains of project organising: project-based firms; projects and programmes; and owners and operators as its principal theoretical contribution. This conceptual framework draws our attention to two important new areas for future research in project organising. The first is at the interfaces between the three domains of project organising: commercial, resourcing, and governance. The second is on project organising as temporary configurations of permanent organisations in coalitions to deliver particular outputs. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.},

In this context a process-oriented strategy, although difficult to manage, can be a better way to handle project transformation. Collective learning then becomes crucial. This article describes some lessons learned when a project manager and team applied a process-oriented strategy in a complex project. Data has been collected through interactive research and evaluation with different methods including surveys, observations and interviews. The analysis shows that it is possible to organize for learning and to manage transformation in a complex context. Important factors for success are a process-oriented strategy, a creative climate, formative evaluation and systematic reflections. A major issue that is discussed in the article is the transfer of outcomes from the project to the participating organizations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Methodology/approach – This study is based on a retrospective longitudinal case study (1980–1995) and informed by research on organizational path dependence. Our research object is SEMATECH, the leading global semiconductor manufacturing consortium. Findings – This longitudinal case study of the research and development consortium SEMATECH shows how and under what conditions a project, once its initial objective had been achieved, managed to turn itself into a permanent organization, that is, it terminated its institutionalized termination. Based on our findings, we argue that the postponing of this specific project's institutionalized termination can be understood by adopting a path dependence perspective that allows for the capturing of self-reinforcing processes to account for the stability of the (once temporary) system. Originality/value of the paper – In this chapter, we question the certainty put forward in organizational studies of projects concerning the ephemeral nature of projects due to their built-in termination mechanism.},

In this paper, we present the "dynamic fractal organization" as a new organizational model. This model departs from the conventional information processing paradigm. Instead, we present a new frontier in organizational theory: the "dynamic fractal organization based on dynamic 'ba'." Dynamic fractal organizations build and utilize a triad relationship of knowledge that integrates and synthesizes tacit and explicit knowledge and creates a third type of knowledge, phronesis. The triad relationship is an upward spiraling process of converting tacit and explicit knowledge, and propels sustainable knowledge transformation across the diverse boundaries within and between organizations, and their environments. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

We examine such innovations more closely and, distinguishing between the components of a product and the ways they are integrated into the system that is the product "architecture," define them as innovations that change the architecture of a product without changing its components. We show that architectural innovations destroy the usefulness of the architectural knowledge of established firms, and that since architectural knowledge tends to become embedded in the structure and information-processing procedures of established organizations, this destruction is difficult for firms to recognize and hard to correct. Architectural innovation therefore presents established organizations with subtle challenges that may have significant competitive implications. We illustrate the concept's explanatory force through an empirical study of the semiconductor photolithographic alignment equipment industry, which has experienced a number of architectural innovations.},

abstract = {We have known for a long time that product development can fruitfully be viewed as an ‘information generating process': it starts with data about market opportunities and technical possibilities, and transforms them into information assets for production and delivery (Clark and Fujimoto, 1991: 20). In this process, highly uncertain and imprecise information is transformed into precise information (such as a production recipe, a market plan, production volumes, etc., see Loch and Terwiesch, 2005; Terwiesch et al., 2002). This implies that new product development (NPD) intrinsically faces uncertainty: the final ‘recipe' is not known at the outset and emerges during the process, and therefore, decisions must be made with incomplete information. As the development of a product progresses, the uncertainty is gradually (although not necessarily monotonically) reduced. As a result, any product development process bears various forms of risks, ranging from market related risks (demand, cash flow, and resource access) and completion risk (technical risk, operational risks) to institutional risks (regulatory risks, social-acceptability risk, and sovereign risk) (Miller and Lessard, 2000: 78–83). Across all categories, uncertainty tends to be high at the initial planning stage and to be reduced over the course of the project. ‘Regulatory risks, for instance, diminish soon after permits are obtained, technical risk drop as engineering experiments are performed, elements of design are defined and construction is completed. Errors are identified and corrected as the system begins operation' (Miller and Lessard, 2000: 83).Information created through experimentation, testing, analysis, and imple- mentation reduces the uncertainty, and choosing when which information is created can be an important source of project value. As Browning et al. (2002: 444) point out, ‘in many cases, lack of value stems less from doing unnec- essary activities and more from doing necessary activities with the wrong information (and then having to redo them).'},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the influence of an organization's research and development structure on innovation projects. It is widely accepted that innovative companies have to pursue exploitative and explorative innovation activities at the same time, either in separated business units or integrated within a single business unit. However, research on the practical consequences of introducing and following the logics of ambidexterity in an organization is scarce. Following a case study-based approach, we develop a barriers approach to innovation based on an explorative study of 10 research and development projects in the automotive industry. By identifying specific barriers to an innovation project, it is possible to outline possible shortcomings of a given organizational structure. We are able to develop six main categories of barriers based on 152 descriptions of different barriers to innovation. Our findings show that projects in a separated research and development environment mainly experience problems in interdepartmental collaboration. Those projects in integrated research and development environments on the other hand, mostly suffer from a lack of motivation for explorative activities, while exploitative activities are preferred. Moreover, there seem to be fewer problems installing adequate structures for organizational ambidexterity compared to implementing these new structures in the mind of the innovators and top-management. We discuss possible underlying reasons for these observations and suggest solutions based on research on different roles in innovation management.},

abstract = {Armand Hatchuel's work marks a turning point in management research and paves the way for a refoundation of management science. Hatchuel's research deals with organizational metabolism rather than organizational change, as he is concerned with the drivers of change and with the organization of innovative collective action. Several theoretical milestones can be put forward. First, Hatchuel offers a theory of the cognitive processes of generativity: while decision theory targets optimization by supporting the selection of a solution, “C-K theory” is a design theory. It accounts for the generation of new alternatives by expanding what is known, this process being driven by desirable unknowns. This theory has provided the theoretical cornerstone characterizing the rationality and organization of innovative or design-oriented collective action. Second, in Hatchuel's view, learning and organizational dynamics are tightly bound. Learning processes are hosted and supported by social relationships, which, in turn, are shaped by the distribution of knowledge. Hatchuel proposes a theory of collective action whereby knowledge and relationships are involved in a dynamic interplay: this theory shows that both markets and hierarchies are special and highly unstable forms of organization, because they imply that either knowledge or relationships are frozen. Management scholars contribute to the study of generative forms of collective action: Hatchuel argues that management science, far from being applied economics or applied sociology, is a basic science devoted to the design and study of new models of collective action. He therefore opens up promising avenues for programs on post-decision paradigms and creative institutions.},

However the Fuzzy Front End is unfortunately the least-well structured part of the innovation process, both in theory and in practice.

Firstly, the activities, characteristics, and challenges of the front end are described. Secondly, a framework of the application fields for different methods and tools is presented: Since a product upgrade requires a different approach compared to radical innovation, where the market is unknown and a new technology is applied, we believe such a framework to be useful for practitioners. Thirdly, a selection of methods and tools that can be applied to the fuzzy front end are presented and allocated within the framework.

abstract = {The concept of design thinking (DT) has emerged in management debates as promising innovation inspired by the way designers work. Despite the growing interest in DT, it is a difficult concept to study due to the lack of coherence between what DT ‘is' in academic and practical terms. While there are numerous normative and often process-focused depictions of DT, they seemlimited in their ability to account forwhat occurs in practice.Given the discussion of DT as a concept, and emerging discussion of its enactment, a framing is needed that acknowledges both aspects. This paper proposes a framing of DT that makes it researchable in both theory and practice, and discusses commonalities and discrepancies in how the concept is usually portrayed in the literature. The paper builds on an empirical interviewstudy in six large organizations, which led to the development of a framework structure and the identification of five themes characterizing DT: User focus, Problem framing, Visualization, Experimentation and Diversity. Each theme is associated with specific principles/mindsets, practices and techniques.Themain contribution of this paper is to propose a framework that includesDT both as an idea and as the enactment of the idea, inspired by the works of Latour.

abstract = {Recent studies on new-idea generation and development have highlighted the role played by network structure in the genesis of new combinations or the process of selecting ideas. However, less attention has been paid to the factors that entice actors to shape social networks during the process of the development of new ideas.This research was conducted in an R{\&}D facility of a semi-conductor company. We analysed the generation of five creative projects and their development over a four-year period. We used a longitudinal approach and collected data through interviews and observations to identify the creative contributions and the actors who were involved at different time periods for each project. We mapped the relationships between actors who contributed to the development of each idea through creative thinking and/or helped it to become accepted both internally and externally over three-year windows. This method generated data on network evolution.We also carried out a qualitative analysis and identified four main factors explaining why actors turn to others during the idea-development process: (1) to gain access to information; (2) to enhance credibility; (3) to exercise one's influence; and (4) to gain access to knowledge through people or objects. We demonstrate that different types of ties or network structures are relied upon to reap different kinds of benefits. This may partially explain network evolution as an idea progresses through different development stages. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This article focuses on individuals working on innovation developments during the unfolding of innovation streams. Innovation streams include both exploitation- and exploration-oriented projects. Those projects imply different temporalities and can be conducted at different paces. This research examines how different temporalities within a single innovation stream are managed first at the level of projects and then among projects. We collected data on an innovation stream in the semiconductor industry. We explain how teams and organization develop processes and tools to address different temporalities. The results show that the process of learning occurs first within projects and then among projects. Our research offers new understandings of the transition of organizations towards a project-based structure by demonstrating that changes in practices can occur first as a reaction to external events, then as the results of new arrangements triggered by management and finally as the consequences of the team's proactive actions.},

These enthusiasms have often en- couraged the too easy assumption that learning processes necessarily lead to organisational im- provement. The usefulness of learning as an instrument of organisational intelligence has to be demonstrated, not assumed. Adaptive processes such as learning are not guaranteed to reach or sustain a global maximum on an outcome surface. In order for proposals for "learning organisations" to be more than vague wishes for improvement, learning must be defined in terms of some specific process and the conditions under which that process does or does not lead to improvement must be established.

abstract = {Purpose – Innovation intermediaries have become key actors in open innovation (OI) contexts. Research has improved the understanding of the managerial challenges inherent to intermediation in situations in which problems are rather well defined. Yet, in some OI situations, the relevant actor networks may not be known, there may be no clear common interest, or severe problems may exist with no legitimate common place where they can be discussed. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the research on innovation intermediaries by showing how intermediaries address managerial challenges related to a high degree of unknown. Design/methodology/approach – The authors draw upon the extant literature to highlight the common core functions of different types of intermediaries. The authors then introduce the “degree of unknown” as a new contingency variable for the analysis of the role of intermediaries for each of these core functions. The authors illustrate the importance of this new variable with four empirical case studies in different industries and countries in which intermediaries are experiencing situations of high level of unknown. Findings – The authors highlight the specific managerial principles that the four intermediaries applied in creating an environment for collective innovation. Originality/value – Thereby, the authors clarify what intermediation in the unknown may entail.

@article{Teece1997,
abstract = {The dynamic capabilities framework analyzes the sources and methods of wealth creation and capture by private enterprise firms operating in environments of rapid technological change. The competitive advantage of firms is seen as resting on distinctive processes (ways of coordinating and combining), shaped by the firm's (specific) asset positions (such as the firm's portfolio of difficult-to-trade knowledge assets and complementary assets), and the evolution path(s) it has adopted or inherited. The importance of path dependencies is amplified where conditions of increasing returns exist. Whether and how a firm's competitive advantage is eroded depends on the stability of market demand, and the ease of replicability (expanding internally) and imitatability (replication by competitors). If correct, the framework suggests that private wealth creation in regimes of rapid technological change depends in large measure on honing internal technological, organizational, and managerial processes inside the firm. In short, identifying new opportunities and organizing effectively and efficiently to embrace them are generally more fundamental to private wealth creation than is strategizing, if by strategizing one means engaging in business conduct that keeps competitors off balance, raises rival's costs, and excludes new entrants.},

Most of the research and applications of design have focused on attitudes, skills, methods, and techniques. These have been applied to tactical issues of the development of products and services, issues of organizational operations, and issues of the vision and strategy of organizations. But there is a principle that distinguishes design as a practice of management from other schools of management over the past century. That principle focuses on the quality of experience for all of those served by organizations, whether for-profit, not-for-profit, or governmental organizations. The design movement in management aims at organizational culture reform. It is profitable for organizations, but it also serves a deeper purpose in enhancing the lives of individuals. At its best, the design movement seeks to bring innovations—sometimes radical innovations—to organizations that have to adapt to new circumstances of economic competition, social expectation, and cultural understanding. This is the challenge to design anticipated decades ago by the famous designer George Nelson, when the tactical uses of design in product development was the center of attention. The new extension of design deeper into organizational culture offers the possibility of significant consequences.},

@article{Gavetti2012,
abstract = {This paper offers an analytical structure to pinpoint the behavioral roots of superior performance, where “behavioral” denotes “being about mental processes.” Such roots are identified in behavioral deviations from market efficiency. The causes of these deviations are behavioral factors that bound firms' ability to pursue and compete for superior opportunities. Because these bounds are systematic and diffused among firms, they ensure that latent opportunities are not competed away. In this setting, the behavioral bases of superior performance stem from a superior ability to overcome focal behavioral bounds. This analytical structure is used to identify the mental processes especially important to firm performance that strategic leaders can reliably manage. Its key insight is that superior opportunities are cognitively distant. They rarely correspond to common ways of thinking. The reason for this is that it is necessary to overcome strong behavioral bounds to pursue these opportunities. This insight contrasts with mainstream behavioral approaches to strategy, which focus on the virtues of local action, and it has two implications: the behavioral essence of superior performance corresponds to strategic leaders' superior ability to manage the mental processes necessary to pursue cognitively distant opportunities; and pursuing the cognitively distant implies a more expansive conception of strategic agency (e.g., the role of strategic leaders) than is acknowledged by mainstream behavioral approaches to strategy. The challenges posed by this conception require a model of human cognition that goes beyond the understanding of bounded rationality that is diffused in current behavioral strategy research. The second part of the paper assesses the traits of a model of human mind that can support the behavioral conception of strategic agency advocated and proposes a unified model of the human mind that centers on associative processes.},

abstract = {Currently, two models of innovation are prevalent in orga- nization science. The “private investment” model assumes returns to the innovator result from private goods and effi- cient regimes of intellectual property protection. The “collec- tive action” model assumes that under conditions of market failure, innovators collaborate in order to produce a public good. The phenomenon of open source software development shows that users program to solve their own as well as shared technical problems, and freely reveal their innovations with- out appropriating private returns from selling the software. In this paper, we propose that open source software development is an exemplar of a compound “private-collective” model of innovation that contains elements of both the private invest- ment and the collective action models and can offer society the “best of both worlds” under many conditions. We describe a new set of research questions this model raises for schol- ars in organization science. We offer some details regarding the types of data available for open source projects in order to ease access for researchers who are unfamiliar with these, and also offer some advice on conducting empirical studies on open source software development processes.},

abstract = {Based on historical data and a seminal text never translated into English, we present an original interpretation of Henri Fayol's (1841–1925) administrative theory. This interpretation, which is consistent with the comments that Fayol later presented about his ‘General and industrial administration' treatise, brings out his pioneering contribution to management studies. Fayol made the ‘unknown' introduced by science into industry the central tenet of modern administration. He foreshadowed major aspects of today's innovation management. More fundamentally, Fayol laid new foundations for the field of management sciences. He drew from the political and philosophical works of the Enlightenment to develop a series of original concepts (in French: pr{\'{e}}voyance, perfectionnement, programme, inconnu, corps social) that were difficult to interpret and to translate. We maintain that Fayol's administrative science is a theory of a ‘creative/political' rationality that still, today, offers better theoretical and explanatory support for management science than economic and bureaucratic theory.},

Recently, research has multiplied, although it has involved little experimental hypothesis testing. Creativity comprises many discrete abilities which often do not correlate very much with each other, and creativity and IQ correlate substantially only at lower IQ levels. Much work has been done in developing evaluative criteria for creative scientific production, and on teaching and learning creativity. Future basic research should concern transfer recall, transformations, reclassification, elaboration, incubation, environmental conditions, and motivation. The social consequences of releasing creative abilities are potentially enormous.},

abstract = {The study approaches the issue of control versus freedom in creative work. A high-tech product development project was studied during its three year execution phase. Thirty engineers worked on the project, in three sub-groups. The climate was measured on eleven occasions and the results fed back to the project group for common analysis. The climate was highly creative, even if it deteriorated somewhat at the end. The management of the project and the structure was loose. These organisational circumstances paved the way for a technologically advanced, spearhead, future-directed but expensive product to come out. However, the customer wanted a less advanced and cheaper product. The goal of the customer had not been clearly communicated to the people in the project. The goal of the project leadership was to develop an advanced product for future applications as well. The goal corresponded to the needs, values and competencies of the project staff. According to the rule-book for effective project management, the project was badly managed and it consequently became a failure. But from a creativity point of view, and in a longer time perspective, it became a success. A follow-up three years later showed that the product had been applied in several new defence systems.

abstract = {This article aims at making international development (ID) projects critical. To that end, it shows that project management (PM) in ID has evolved as an offshoot of conventional PM moving like the latter, but at varying speeds, from a traditional approach suited to blueprint projects where tools matter (1960s-1980s); towards eclectic and contingent approaches suited to process projects where people matter the most (1980s-now); and finally pointing towards the potential contribution of a critical perspective which focuses on issues of power (1980s-now). Consequently, it points to a confluence between the Critical Project Studies movement and Critical Development Studies movements. More specifically, it argues that the postdevelopment, the Habermasian, the Foucauldian and the neo-Marxist lenses may be effectively called upon in that scholarship. Thus, it suggests a framework to encourage project actors to reflect on their personal positions in light of the power relations which shape PM in ID. {\textcopyright} 2014 IPMA and Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Alliances and networks formed by two or more organizations are an increasingly common means to cope with environmental uncertainty frequently resulting from incomplete knowledge. At the same time, alliances and networks must address uncertainty caused by the form itself, which unlike risk, is not calculable. Our review and analysis of the literature on the topic first distinguishes between the concepts of risk and uncertainty, and then identifies three gaps in the literature that offer directions for future research. First, dyadic alliances, rather than broader networks, have been the predominant focus of researchers, limiting our understanding of the scope of uncertainty. Second, previous research concentrates on vaguely defined interorganizational relations and not more in-depth collaborations, which are far more meaningful and have a greater impact on addressing uncertainty. Third, a governance perspective has typically been applied to deal with the risks and uncertainties ensuing from alliances and networks, limiting an understanding of the impact of uncertainty on practice. To address these concerns, we call for an emphasis on genuine uncertainties rather than risks, on consideration of alliances and networks of three or more organizations rather than only dyads, and moving beyond a governance perspective, considering also how managers actually ‘practice uncertainties' in face of their inability to control, reduce or even avoid the lack of knowledge.

abstract = {High-quality creative designs create tremendous value for organizations, but how do individual designers learn to produce better designs? Learning often presumes evaluation of performance that is objective and immediate, but in creative design evaluation is social and temporally displaced, providing hard-tointerpret signals for learning. Drawing on data from a ten-year panel of almost 180,000 T-shirt design submissions and 150 million design evaluations on an online crowdsourcing platform, we investigate how individuals learn from their own work and vicariously learn from observing others' work. We find that in the absence of vicarious learning, individuals experience “design myopia” resulting in successively lower quality designs before reaching a positive learning rate. Furthermore, individuals learn from evaluating good examples of others, but they generally fail to learn from evaluating bad examples. We also find that experience helps individuals not only to gain high evaluations from others but also to learn to understand the “black box” of how designs are chosen for production. We discuss implications for the development of online crowdsourcing platforms and for the management of creative design more broadly.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new conceptualization of the project-oriented organization. The project-oriented organization is conceptualized as an entrepreneurial, future- and stakeholder-oriented innovating organization, which uses projects as temporary, task-focused organizations, to define, develop, and implement its strategies, to transform its structure, culture and behavior, and to define and develop new products, services, and business models. The concept of the project-oriented organization consists of the three segments (1) values, (2) structures, and (3) people. For each segment three important areas are described, which characterize a project-oriented organization. The model is theoretically based on a wide spectrum of management disciplines: (1) The orientations in the value segment have been developed in entrepreneurship, strategic management and technology and innovation management; (2) The foundations for the design of the socio-technical artefacts in the structure segment of derived from organizational design, planning and controlling, and ICT systems theory; (3) The foundations for the elements of the human side come from organizational behavior, human resource management, and knowledge management theories. Our model shows a clear linkage to these theories, references key articles, and gives special consideration to empirical studies in the realm of projects, programs, project portfolios, and project-based or project-oriented organizations. Thus, our assumption that the elements of our model are supposed to increase project success, innovation success, and business success is based on empirical evidence.},

@article{Christiansen2007,
abstract = {Within some streams of thinking in the management of innovation and product development, the crux is the manager's active engagement in the evaluation, selection and control of the various activities through gate and portfolio meetings in which information is presented and decisions are made that manage innovation projects at a distance. This traditional managerial perspective regards the meetings as (important) 'obligatory passage points' but cannot explain a number of observations that reveal few decisions being made at those meetings. A network process perspective on the management of innovation is derived as an alternative to the normative linear view. This alternative perspective makes it possible to explain how innovation projects actually consist of myriad actions, negotiations, and micro-decisions in the effort to create strong networks, leaving few decisions for the official gate and portfolio meetings. Through the analysis of two cases, this paper demonstrates how project managers work to stabilize the network in order to involve numerous human and non-human actors and to encourage more and more of them into joining the network. Successfully establishing stable networks and successfully filling the templates for their projects leaves little room--and requires little intervention--for decision makers at portfolio meetings, where approvals are sought rather than decisions made. This study explains how gate and portfolio management meetings are, in some instances, better viewed as checkpoints rather than as decision meetings, how decision making is displaced from the meetings, and how the use of gate and portfolio management systems have created a number of mandatory templates which must be dealt with by the project managers. These mandatory documents function as boundary objects between and among the different worlds of the actors involved and establish new obligatory passage points in the management process; thus boundary objects become transformed into obligatory passage points. Implications for managers and research are outlined, including methods of dealing with the management of product innovation projects when the focus shifts from planning, preparations and decision making toward the co-creation of technology and markets and involves interessement of human and non-human actors.

It addresses the role of (1) experience accumulation, (2) knowledge articulation, and (3) knowledge codification processes in the evolution of dynamic, as well as operational, routines. The argument is made that dynamic capabilities are shaped by the coevolution of these learning mechanisms. At any point in time, firms adopt a mix of learning behaviors constituted by a semiautomatic accumulation of experience and by deliberate investments in knowledge articulation and codification activities. The relative effectiveness of these capability-building mechanisms is analyzed here as contingent upon selected features of the task to be learned, such as its frequency, homogeneity, and degree of causal ambiguity. Testable hypotheses about these effects are derived. Somewhat counterintuitive implications of the analysis include the relatively superior effectiveness of highly deliberate learning processes such as knowledge codification at lower levels of frequency and homogeneity of the organizational task, in contrast with common managerial practice.},

abstract = {Although learning from projects has gained much importance in research and practice, progress in understanding and improving inter-project learning appears to be slight. We argue that the adoption of a sender/receiver approach limits the learning effectiveness in project-based organisations. Drawing upon the notion of learning as a social activity embedded in an organisational context, we develop the argument that learning from projects takes place within projects rooted in the historical, organisational and cultural context of previous and current projects. We underpin our argument with results from a multiple-case study on learning in construction organisations. We show that learning cannot be segregated from immediate practice and occurs when individuals engage in project work. Particularly the orientation towards project goals and project-overarching ambitions or trajectories can serve as contextual binder for learning in and between projects.},

abstract = {Accurate marketing research depends on accurate user judgments regarding their needs. However, for very novel products or in product categories characterized by rapid change - such as "high technology" products - most potential users will not have the real-world experience needed to problem solve and provide accurate data to inquiring market researchers. In this paper I explore the problem and propose a solution: Marketing research analyses which focus on what I term the "lead users" of a product or process. Lead users are users whose present strong needs will become general in a marketplace months or years in the future. Since lead users are familiar with conditions which lie in the future for most others, they can serve as a need-forecasting laboratory for marketing research. Moreover, since lead users often attempt to fill the need they experience, they can provide new product concept and design data as well. In this paper I explore how lead users can be systematically identified, and howlead user perceptions and preferences can be incorporated into industrial and consumer marketing research analyses of emerging needs for new products, processes and services.},

Earlier research has pointed to how difficult it is to solve paradoxes and has suggested overarching approaches for their resolution. The purpose with this article is to further the understanding of how paradox handling works in practice. The article builds on interviews with CEOs of 20 global organizations selected out of their ability to create both economic and social value. The article aims to contribute to the literature by (a) showing how CEOs relate to paradoxes and (b) strategies for solving the paradoxes. Suggestions are made for how this develops the current literature in the area, and what further research may look into. The article informs industrial practice by showing examples of managerial solutions to paradoxes and by highlighting paradox resolution as a source of competitive advantage.},

abstract = {In the dictionary, integrity means wholeness, completeness, soundness. In products, integrity is the source of sustainable competitive advantage. Products with integrity perform superbly, provide good value, and satisfy customers' expectations in every respect, including such intangibles as their look and feel. Consider this example from the auto industry. In 1987, Mazda put a racy four-wheel steering system in a five-door family hatchback. Honda introduced a comparable system in the Prelude, a sporty, two-door coupe. Most of Honda's customers installed the new technology; Mazda's system sold poorly. Potential customers felt the fit--or misfit--between the car and the new component, and they responded accordingly. Companies that consistently develop products with integrity are coherent, integrated organizations. This internal integrity is visible at the level of strategy and structure, in management and organization, and in the skills, attitudes, and behavior of individual designers, engineers, and operators. Moreover, these companies are integrated externally: customers become part of the development organization. Integrity starts with a product concept that describes the new product from the potential customer's perspective--"pocket rocket" for a sporty, subcompact car, for example. Whether the final product has integrity will depend on two things: how well the concept satisfies potential customers' wants and needs and how completely the concept has been embodied in the product's details. In the most successful development organizations, "heavyweight" product managers are responsible for leading both tasks, as well as for guiding the creation of a strong product concept.

abstract = {Despite widespread use of forced distribution rating systems (FDRSs), the potential for this performance appraisal method to lead to adverse impact (AI) in a layoff context has yet to be examined empirically. Thus, the current study uses a Monte Carlo simulation to examine the likelihood of encountering AI violations when an FDRS is used in the context of layoffs. The primary research questions included an examination of how AI violations change depending on the definition of the employment action (i.e., retention vs. layoff), the length of the repeated layoffs, and whether or not laid off employees are replaced each year. The current study also examined the impact of the size of the organization, the percentage of the workforce laid off, and the type of AI calculation method used on the likelihood of AI violations. Results suggest that defining the employment action as layoffs (rather than as retentions) may result in a greater likelihood of AI violations, and AI violations are likely to peak in the 1st year of use. Further, replacing laid off employees may result in higher levels of AI over time as compared with not replacing layoffs. Additionally, the greatest risk for AI occurs when the organization size is large (i.e., N = 10,000) and when certain AI calculation methods are used. Results are discussed in terms of their practical and legal implications for organizations.},

A longitudinal case study, comprising non-participant observation over three years, was carried out of the early design phase of a major railway tunnel project. Availability and familiarity heuristics were found important, as well as coordination neglect — a general tendency to focus more on partitioning tasks than on coordination needs. Satisficing, meaning that the first acceptable organising solution is selected and retained, was found to be strong in temporary, transitory contexts. Shared heuristics were manifest as short catchphrases, or mantras. Clients should develop meta-routines and meta-functions to support adaptation within, and learning between, projects.},

Defining the algorithms that will help AVs make these moral decisions is a formidable challenge. We found that participants to six MTurk studies approved of utilitarian AVs (that sacrifice their passengers for the greater good), and would like others to buy them, but they would themselves prefer to ride in AVs that protect their passengers at all costs. They would disapprove of enforcing utilitarian AVs, and would be less willing to buy such a regulated AV. Accordingly, regulating for utilitarian algorithms may paradoxically increase casualties by postponing the adoption of a safer technology.},

We consider the context within which we wrote the original article, with particular reference to the theoretical, empirical, and managerial problems salient at that time, and comment on the likely reasons the article has had a sustained influence in the field. Looking forward, we first ask whether the paradoxes and inconsistencies we discussed are still fundamental organizational challenges, and then go further to consider ways the domain of innovation itself has changed. We suggest that because of fundamental shifts in communication and information processing costs and the increasing modularity of products and services, the nature and locus of innovation have changed over the past decade. These secular trends have profound implications for our theories of innovation and organizations. Our extant theory and research are increasingly uncoupled from the phenomena. We would be well served to revisit the nature, locus, and basic processes of innovation.},

The design and strategic literature underline the possibility of triggering a multiproduct value-expansion dynamic based on the creation of new concepts dynamically twinned with corporate strategy. However, the multiproject-management literature-portfolio, program, and platform-lags behind and remains focused on ex ante coordination, resource allocation and selectionism. Thus, there are still few indications of the processes that stimulate and orient continuous, profitable multiproject creative expansion. Bridging the multiproject-management literature and design theory, we propose a model of multiproject lineage management (MPLM), which focuses on the key processes that drive exploration efforts and shape innovation trajectory. We conduct a multiple longitudinal case analysis in the automobile sector. Based on this analysis, we expose the principles of MPLM, mapping the roles of corporate, program and project management within a global expansion project. Finally, we highlight our contributions to managerial practices and the related literature. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {Rather than the future of organization design (academics make justifiably reluctant futurists), I want to discuss a possible future for the science of organization design – one that I hope will come to pass. I understand organization design to refer to a particular form of human problem solving in which the problem is one of getting multiple individuals with diverse knowledge and interests to collectively achieve something that they could not by acting individually. Because bounded rationality affects not only the members but also the designers of organizations, solutions may be imperfect and unsuccessful, and many may have arisen almost unintentionally. But clearly there are better and worse solutions, and given the predominantly organizational nature of our economy, many good solutions exist in the form of the organizations that surround us. Is organization design an important field of study? If we judge importance in terms of potential impact on human affairs, then the answer is a resounding “yes”. Further, the importance of improving our knowledge of organization design is likely to remain high in the foreseeable future because of several trends. These trends include advances in information technology that encourage experimentation with new organizational designs, large economies like India and China attempting to rapidly transform the organizational infrastructure of their public administration, the professionalization of the NGO and charity sector, and multinational corporations' increasing attempts to exploit globally distributed intellectual resources.

abstract = {We augment transaction cost economics' (TCE) bounded rationality assumption with heuristics (framing) and cognitive biases to expand the understanding of hierarchical governance in the theory. TCE traditionally puts opportunism in the frontseat, while primarily relegating bounded rationality to the support role of invoking incomplete contracts. The theory also suggests that hierarchical governance effectively mitigates opportunism-based transaction costs, making it difficult to explain why hierarchies are not always used. However, when an augmented bounded rationality assumption is incorporated into TCE, we argue, first, that bounded rationality is a separate source of transaction costs, and, second, that these costs are not equally mitigated by all forms of hierarchy. Instead, different hierarchical forms are associated with particular frames and social referents that naturally enhance specific bounded rationality- based conflicts, allowing certain hierarchical forms to mitigate bounded rationality-based transaction costs better than others. As a result, bounded rationality takes a frontseat in the theory, addressing prior critiques of TCE, expanding the governance questions addressed by the theory and creating a new moderating role for asset specificity in internal exchanges.},

abstract = {This paper investigates interrelationships of product design, organization design, processes for learning and managing knowledge, and competitive strategy. This paper uses the principles of nearly decomposable systems to investigate the ability of standardized interfaces between components in a product design to embed coordination of product development processes. Embedded coordination creates ‘hierarchical coordination' without the need to continually exercise authority—enabling effective coordination of processes without the tight coupling of organizational structures. We develop concepts of modularity in product and organization designs based on standardized component and organization interfaces. Modular product architectures create information structures that provide the ‘glue' that holds together the loosely coupled parts of a modular organization design. By facilitating loose coupling, modularity can also reduce the cost and difficulty of adaptive coordination, thereby increasing the strategic flexibility of firms to respond to environmental change. Modularity in product and organization designs therefore enables a new strategic approach to the management of knowledge based on an intentional, carefully managed loose coupling of a firm's learning processes at architectural and component levels of product creation processes.},

Anchored in a comparative case study, this paper discusses how the interior processes of a project are influenced by its historical and organizational context. The paper illustrates how the structures and procedures employed in a project have to be understood in relation to previous and simultaneous courses of activity, to future plans, and to standard operating procedures, traditions, and the norms of its surroundings. The findings suggest that future research on project management needs to extend its temporal scope, analyzing how project practices evolve through history over prior, present, and future projects, as well as its organizational scope, analyzing how project practices relate to long-term institutions as well as simultaneous activities in its environment. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.},

It employs cross-functional, cross-company teams that work through common global business processes. IBM uses cross-functional teams consisting of hundreds of people to implement its new Smart Planet strategy. These teams are constantly being formed, dismantled, and reconfigured to work on anything from the Stockholm traffic system to a smart electric grid for the island of Malta. This constant assembly and disassembly of teams is what makes IBM a reconfigurable organization. As a response to organizational complexity, IBM begins with a functional structure and assembles teams capable of addressing any dimensionproducts, countries, new businesses, or Smart Planet solutions.

@article{Lei1996,
abstract = {Traditional approaches to studying competitive advantage, while valuable, are not adequate to explain how firms can operate effectively in turbulent and often chaotic environments. A resource or skill-based view focusing on development and application of core competences is offered to supplement the traditional approaches. We present a model of the development and outcomes of dynamic core competences based on organizational meta-learning. A firm's core competence(s) is defined as a set of problem-defining and problem-solving insights that fosters the development of idiosyncratic strategic growth alternatives. Dynamic core competences are based on the integration into systemic meta-learning of universal and tacit knowledge through information transfer, redefinition of heuristics and continuous improvement based on experimentation and the development of firm-specific skills based on dynamic routines. Dynamic core competences can be leveraged to create growth alternatives of global diversification, new applications of existing technologies and/or the development of new lines of business. Finally, dynamic core competences can be used to reduce uncertainty and to induce path dependencies that create causal ambiguity (making imitation from other firms difficult). In so doing, they can form the basis of competitive advantages. {\textcopyright} 1996 JAI Press Inc. All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.},

Findings indicate that transformational leadership behaviors contribute significantly to adopting generative thinking and pursuing exploratory innovation. Transactional leadership behaviors, on the other hand, facilitate improving and extending existing knowledge and are associated with exploitative innovation. In addition, we argue that environmental dynamism needs to be taken into account to fully understand the effectiveness of strategic leaders. Our study provides new insights that misfits rather than fits between leadership behaviors and innovative outcomes matter in dynamic environments. Hence, we contribute to the debate on the role of strategic leaders in managing exploration and exploitation, not only by examining how specific leadership behaviors impact innovative outcomes, but also by revealing how the impact of leadership is contingent upon dynamic environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {How organizations exert leadership in interorganizational, predominantly hierarchical networks is well researched. However, there are also networks that are heterarchical, not hierarchical, in nature, i.e., where no organizational actor formally presides over the other member organizations and where leadership is nevertheless practiced and accepted by the network members. But how is an organization able to lead under these structural conditions and in particular, to capitalize - in the leadership process - on its membership in more than one network? Informed by structuration theory, we investigate this practice of 'network maneuvering,' that is, how an organization skillfully takes advantage of the reciprocal influences between two different forms of networks. In particular, we study how Intel de facto leads the SEMATECH consortium (i.e., a heterarchical network) and guides technology development along its supply chain (i.e., a hierarchical network). Network maneuvering is enabled in this case by two mutually reinforming practices (i.e., roadmapping and roadmap gap filling) that are centered around a key resource (i.e., a roadmap as an artifact). Based upon our findings, we provide practical guidance and theoretical insights as to how and under what circumstances this type of maneuvering in and across two (different types of) networks substitutes for formally legitimated leadership. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The technologies used by organizations in their pursuit of intelligence can be imagined to change over time as a result of responding to the successes and failures associated with the technologies. Although technologies of rationality seem clearly to be effective instruments of exploitation in relatively simple situations and to derive their adaptive advantage from those capabilities, their ventures in more complex explorations seem often to lead to huge mistakes and thus unlikely to be sustained by adaptive processes. Whether their survival as instruments of exploratory novelty in complex situations is desirable is a difficult question to answer, but it seems likely that any such survival may require hitchhiking on their successes in simpler worlds. Survival may also be served by the heroism of fools and the blindness of true believers. Their imperviousness to feedback is both the despair of adaptive intelligence and, conceivably, its salvation.

abstract = {The strategic role of new product development and innovation makes design performance a central concern of managers. Project management therefore appears to be an adequate solution to the integration problems raised by these activities. Work such as that of Clark et Fujimoto (1991) has helped make heavyweight project management a dominant organizational model. In this article, we wish to question this tendency to equate projects and innovation. This tendency can, in fact, appear surprising inasmuch as Clark et Fujimoto indicate that their research does not take into account the question of advanced engineering or basic research. We therefore believe that it can lead to improper use of the project format to manage innovation. We feel that, in line with work on project classification a distinction should be drawn between the various design situations to which different types of projects will be suited. Qualitative research conducted at a European automobile manufacturer on Telematics services will allow us to identify the management methods suited to the most innovative projects, i.e. those for which neither technologies nor customer requirements are known at the start of the project (referred to by Atkinson et al. (2006) as “soft” projects) We will show how these situations shake up traditional project management models and will propose five management principles adapted to this new situation.},

We show that although this influence has changed significantly over the years, there are still unexplored opportunities left by this seminal work. Our approach enables us to identify promising directions for future research that reinforce the themes anchored in March's article. In particular, we call for reconnecting current research to the behavioral roots of this article and uncovering the microfoundations of exploration and exploitation. Our analysis further identifies opportunities for integrating this framework with resource-based theories and considering how exploration and exploitation can be sourced and integrated within and across organizational boundaries.

@article{Swan2010,
abstract = {Many different types of organizations use projects to accomplish specific tasks, especially tasks that involve innovation and change. However, there are often problems associated with both learning within projects and learning transfer from projects to the wider organization. Previous research suggests that these problems vary according to the organizational context, in particular the extent to which the organization is centred on the delivery of projects. Also, the link between project-based learning and organizational learning may be far from seamless, and may require the deployment of a range of learning mechanisms to be effective. In this article we explore and explain these problems through an empirical study which examined project- based learning across different organizational contexts. This study highlights the limitations of learning mechanisms based on reflection and codification. It suggests that firms generally only learn from projects, if at all, via the accumulation of experience amongst groups and individuals. The study suggests, however, that the accumulation of experience is most pronounced in organizational contexts which are project centred and where project management capabilities are well developed. In contrast, in organizations where projects are more varied and occasional, the struggle to exploit the highly heterogeneous forms of learning created within projects is greater.},

@article{Loch2008,
abstract = {New ventures often do not correctly foresee real market opportunities or the best way to address them. How to cope with unforeseen, unpredictable factors, also re- ferred to as unknown unknowns, is critical for new ventures. Findings in the fields of innovation and project management have shown that dealing with the unpredictable requires management approaches different from those used for classical plan-and- achieve-the-target projects. Management approaches for novel initiatives include a combination of trial-and-error learning (i.e., flexible redefinition of the new venture business model as new information emerges) and selectionism (i.e., running multiple parallel trials and choosing the best performing approach ex post). The manage- ment approach must be chosen when the venture is set up. This requires a venture management team to diagnose at the outset whether unknown unknowns are present (or possible), although unknown unknowns cannot be identified initially by defini- tion because they emerge over time. Anecdotal testimony from experienced venture managers and project managers suggests they have a feeling for where their knowl- edge is limited. However, such a claim is controversial. Some researchers think the concept of diagnosing unforeseeable influence factors is an oxymoron. Thus, the research question in this article is this: How can unforeseeable influence factors in a new venture be diagnosed at the outset? Research to date has insufficiently ad- dressed the a priori identification of the type of uncertainty faced by a new venture. Based on models from decision theory, this article suggests dividing the overall problem of structuring the venture into subproblems for which the management team can identify knowledge gaps. Using a case study, the article describes how knowledge gaps were identified for the subareas of a new venture in a real situation and how this diagnosis was used to correctly identify the areas where unknown un- knowns lurk. These areas were managed in a different way (i.e., with learning and experimentation) than the other subproblems (i.e., with targets and deadlines). As a result, the venture could successfully respond to unforeseeable events. The results of this study suggest that a decomposition of the overall venture management prob- lem into subproblems is feasible and natural to managers, that a qualitative assess- ment of knowledge gaps and vulnerability to unknown unknowns is possible, and that a structured, process-like approach can be used to identify subproblems, to determine their uncertainty profiles, and to update the uncertainty profiles. These results are immediately useful to venture management and venture capitalists in setting up the venture's structure for effective response to uncertainty. The results advance research about uncertainty management by offering a systematic set of questions for the diagnosis of unknown unknowns before they can be formally described. The usefulness of this process can be tested further in more formal empirical research.},

abstract = {In literature and R{\&}D organizations alike, project success consists in minimizing the deviations from set targets in terms of quality, cost and time. The main management task is to execute and monitor progress to reduce risks – assuming that project attributes are known, necessary resources can be estimated and a reasonable time table can be agreed upon. In such a context, evaluating project success is easy. However, in an innovative context, setting project targets initially is difficult and the contributions of the projects sometimes are of an unexpected nature. This paper investigates if projects can be evaluated in terms of how they contribute to the building of innovative capabilities of the firm instead of independently. Based on a case study at the R{\'{e}}gie Autonome des Transports Parisians and the theoretical framework of innovation fields, a framework for evaluating projects from an additional perspective is proposed. Based on the following four criteria: financial resources, the development of a structured, refined and expanded strategic vision, developed competences (with related suppliers) and identification of knowledge gaps (occasionally with related partners for knowledge production), this framework shows how seemingly failed R{\&}D projects can instead be considered as invaluable to the overall innovation process.

abstract = {The development of new system capabilities typically depends upon the prior success of advanced technology research and development efforts. These systems developments inevitably face the three major challenges of any project: performance, schedule and budget. Done well, advanced technology programs can substantially reduce the uncertainty in all three of these dimensions of project management. Done poorly, or not at all, and new system developments suffer from cost overruns, schedule delays and the steady erosion of initial performance objectives. It is often critical for senior management to be able to determine which of these two paths is more likely—and to respond accordingly. The challenge for system and technology managers is to be able to make clear, well-documented assessments of technology readiness and risks, and to do so at key points in the life cycle of the program. In the mid 1970s, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) introduced the concept of “technology readiness levels” (TRLs) as a discipline-independent, programmatic figure of merit (FOM) to allow more effective assessment of, and communication regarding the maturity of new technologies. In 1995, the TRL scale was further strengthened by the articulation of the first definitions of each level, along with examples (J. Mankins, Technology readiness levels, A White Paper, NASA, Washington, DC, 1995. [1]). Since then, TRLs have been embraced by the U.S. Congress' General Accountability Office (GAO), adopted by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), and are being considered for use by numerous other organizations. Overall, the TRLs have proved to be highly effective in communicating the status of new technologies among sometimes diverse organizations. This paper will review the concept of “technology readiness assessments”, and provide a retrospective on the history of “TRLs” during the past 30 years. The paper will conclude with observations concerning prospective future directions for the important discipline of technology readiness assessments.},

abstract = {Research summary: We investigate how organizational adaptation to interdependence shifts is influenced by “integrators.” These are formally mandated managerial roles meant to promote coordination across specialized but interdependent organizational subunits, yet they do so without relying on formal authority. While much has been learned about how integrators promote steady-state coordination within a known pattern of interdependence, less is known about their impact on organizational adaptation when the pattern of interdependence itself is unknown. We discuss mechanisms by which integrators may nonetheless aid organizational adaptation and learning processes in such situations, and test our hypotheses in the context of a regulatory change that affected the in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics sector in the United Kingdom using a differences-in-differences design. Managerial summary: Organizational structure can influence how an organization adapts to change.We investigate how a regulatory change in the provision of fertility treatments in theUnited Kingdom forced clinics to change their workflows, and whether the presence of integrator roles enabled clinics to adapt to these changes. It is well known that integrator roles in general are valuable in coordinating across specialized organizational units, but this research points to the surprising implication that their value may persist even when the workflow being coordinated changes suddenly, in ways that nobody necessarily comprehends. Our research highlights the fact that even in an intensively science-based work context, the “technology of organizing” can have a significant role in shaping organizational performance.},

abstract = {Keil, Zahra and Maula discuss the importance of corporate venture capital (CVC) as a learning mechanism, a theme that is consistent with some of the arguments presented by Basu et al. and Jelinek and Day. Specifically, they note that while there is consensus on the importance of learning as a strategic benefit of CVC, evidence is mixed. Existing studies highlight the contingent learning benefits of CVC, whereas others highlight barriers to such learning. Keil et al. use the organizational learning perspective to develop their arguments, adopting a “portfolio” perspective on CVC investment where the firm has a combination of different investments with different motives, goals and time horizons. Keil and colleagues propose that the characteristics of such a portfolio could influence the potential explorative and exploitative learning of incumbents who need to be adept at managing and balancing exploration and exploitation. A key point that the authors propose is that learning through CVC investments differs from other inter-organizational relationships. In managing this portfolio, there is a great need for knowledge integration as a means of making sense of what the firm learns through CVC. Their analysis and model indicate that the volume of CVC investments can significantly influence the explorative and exploitative learning an organization may experience. The extent of this learning depends greatly on the degree of core business relatedness, venture relatedness, dispersion and autonomy and the existence of knowledge transfer and integration mechanisms.},

abstract = {Literature Review New Product Development (NPD) performance firstly appeared as a sufficient way to maintain a competitive advantage. The literature on NPD tackled the issue by defining models of development project organization (Brown and Eisenhardt 1995; Clark and Fujimoto 1991; Midler 1993). Although it succeeded to dramatically improve development cost and quality, NPD is challenged by the increasing pressure to develop more innovation-intensive products(Hatchuel and al. 2006). As a consequence, researches focus more and more on front-end activities (Smith and Reinertsen 1991; Ulrich and Eppinger 1995) and on the effective integration of differentiating innovations within development projects (Chesbrough 2003; Iansiti 1998). But the link between product performance and the ability of the firm to maintain a strategic advantage remains puzzling. The NPD approach focuses roughly on the transition from R to D on a single generation of products. So it hardly screens the progression of a competitive advantage and misses the inter-project learning cycles (Maidique and Zirger 1985). Recently the concept of dynamic capabilities (Teece and al. 1997) renewed this approach and enlarged the relevant scope of evaluation to technological trajectories, or intertemporal integration across projects (Marsh and Stock 2006). Research purpose Despite the dynamic capability approach looking promising, we still miss accurate lenses to identify and evaluate the progression of a single innovation (for example a technological feature) across different projects. Therefore we define the concept of innovation route to characterize this trajectory between project development activities and what we call ‘knowledge activities': advanced research and technical design rules activities. We think that there are important sources of progress in a better coordination between this two processes. Methodology et Data collection We used this framework on two case studies, following an inductive methodology that was proven to be particularly relevant for such new issues (Eisenhardt 1989). We chose to focus the study on the automotive industry. We had access to key managers and intern documentation of car manufacturers and tier-1 suppliers. We conducted 42 interviews of various manager profiles (project, research, purchasing, support, technical{\ldots}) that were involved in the progression of two technological features. The overall approach consisted in tracking the route of two innovations from their very rough beginnings to their multi-product deployment, by using 4 criteria: customer value, integrability within new products, technology maturity, and profitability. Research implications The first important result is to confirm the relevance of such multi-project approaches that aim to better understand the nature of dynamic capabilities, and the way of managing them. The case studies also showed that innovation management cannot only consist in the management of a succession of projects, but rather of several innovation routes across projects. Our current research focuses on the definition of a reliable evaluation pattern to follow the improvement of a technological feature along theses routes. Based on this framework, we are to shift from a case study approach to a systematic innovation process benchmark, in connection with academics and companies from Japan and the United States.},

This paper seeks to make sense of this development and the current state of project management research.

The paper proposes a categorization of the published articles into seven ‘schools of thought': Optimization School, Factor School, Contin- gency School, Behaviour School, Governance School, Relationship School and Decision School. The schools vary in terms of their main focus and use of the project concept, major research questions, methodological approaches and type of theorizing. It is suggested that a better awareness on how to make use of the schools and the identified perspectives would stimulate cross-fertilization, unification and thus enhance a plural- istic understanding of projects and project management at the same time as it would prepare research to frame more accurately the problems of contemporary projects. In that respect, the paper offers ideas on how to navigate at the crossroads between specialization and fragmentation, between the search for novel topics and improve- ments of existing knowledge.},

In particular, innovation activities are almost always conducted within a project framework, and there is a growing body of research at the intersection of project and innovation management. This special issue bridges the fields of innovation management and project management by presenting a collection of articles illustrating collaboration and cross- fertilization between these two dynamic fields.

This has created a growing need for cross-fertilization and collaboration between research disciplines. According to prior studies, the sharing of concepts, ideas and empirical domains with other disciplines may promote cross-fertilization. We challenge this one-sided view. Based on an analysis of the parallel development of the neighboring disciplines of innovation studies and project management, we show that the sharing of concepts and empirical domains can have ambivalent effects. Under conditions of ideological distancing, shared concepts and domains will be narrowly assimilated − an effect we call ‘encapsulation' – which creates an illusion of sharing, while promoting further self-containment. By comparison, reflexive meta-theories and cross-disciplinary community-building will enable a form of sharing that promotes cross-fertilization. Our findings inform research on research specialization, cross-fertilization and effectiveness of interdisciplinary collaboration.},

abstract = {An organisation's portfolio of new product development (NPD) projects represents its potential for survival. Innovation ambidexterity holds the key to longevity. Accordingly, selecting the right projects for a portfolio critically impacts organisational success, both in the short and longer term. Selecting for successful portfolios is further complicated in dynamic, highly competitive and highly regulated markets. Furthermore, in current economies that demand value from investment, decision-making around project selection for the portfolio becomes even more crucial. However, there is a dearth of discussion and empirical evidence that focuses on project portfolio selection and more specifically in contexts of ambidexterity and ongoing change. Moreover, the tensions between exploratory and exploitative projects are likely to be made salient during project portfolio selection, and manifest in conflicts between different selection options, yet these tensions have not yet been addressed in the portfolio selection literature. Drawing on the current and heretofore non-connected literatures across fields of ambidexterity and paradox, project portfolio selection, cognition and performance control, this paper proposes an initial conceptual model of the factors that impact project portfolio selection and ambidexterity. This paper contributes to a greater appreciation of the pivotal role of project portfolio selection, as distinct from project and portfolio management, in generating a portfolio that drives organisational success.

abstract = {To create a competitive advantage, firms need to find activity configurations that are not only internally consistent, but also appropriate given the firm's current environment. This challenge is particularly acute after firms have experienced an environmental change that has shifted the existing competitive la ndscape and created new, high-performing sets of activity choices. How should firms organize to explore and search such an altered performance landscape? While it has been noted that adaptive entities need to maintain a balance of exploration and exploitation, little is known about how different organizational structures moderate this balance. With the help of an agentbased simulation model, we study the value of three different organizational structures: a centralized organization, in which decisions are made only at the level of the firm as a whole; a decentralized organization, in which decisions are made independently in two divisions; and a temporarily decentralized firm, which starts out with a decentralized structure and later reintegrates. We find that if interactions among a firm's activities are pervasive, neither the centralized nor the permanently decentralized organizational structure leads to high performance. In this case, temporary decentralization—an organizational structure that has not found much attention in the literature—yields the highest long-term performance. This organizational structure allows the firm both to avoid low-performing activity configurations and to eventually coordinate across its divisions. Thus, even if the decision problem a .rm faces is not fully decomposable, a temporary bifurcation can lead to a higher long-term performance outcome. Initial decentralized exploration is, however, costly in the short run, as compared to centralized exploration. As a result, a tradeoff exists between the short-term costs of decentralized exploration and the longterm benefits of reaching higher performance. As interactions across and within divisions increase, the optimal length of decentralized exploration tends to grow. Paralleling our first result, we further show that even if a decision problem is decomposable, that is, can be perfectly modularized, it can be beneficial to create a temporary decision allocation that creates "unnecessary" interdependencies across the subsystems. This benefit arises in particular when the modules are complex by themselves. In both cases, an initial phase of exploration, enabled by an appropriate organizational structure, followed by refinement and coordination, enabled by a different structure, leads to high performance. To illustrate our general model, we focus on incumbent firms' responses to the Internet and discuss implications for the product design process},

@article{Laroche1995,
abstract = {How should we understand decision-making in organizations? And how important is it for our understanding of organizations? A wide body of empirical and theoretical research-labeled here as the decision-making perspective -assumes that decision-making is a fundamental element of organizational processes, and aims to identify different types of decision-making processes in organizations. But what exactly is decision-making? The paper argues that this perspective suffers from insufficient debate on the definition of its research object. One of the main limits of the decision-making perspective is its understanding of organizational decision-making as series of separate decision-making episodes. Stressing the continuity of organizational processes, an emerging "action perspective" challenges this view. It argues that decision and decision-making are either rare, marginal phenomena, or artificial constructs producing biased observations. Thus, some authors suggest that we would better do without decision-making. The paper argues that, because people in organizations think of decision and decision-making as realities, the concept of organizational action should not be opposed to decision and decision-making. Decision and decision-making are best understood as social representations: they influence organizations' members' ways of understanding and behaving in organizations. They influence processes, they facilitate action, and they give meaning to what happens in organizations. As organization members think and act in terms of decision-making, a theory of organizational action cannot simply do without a theory of decision-making.},

abstract = {The last 50 years has seen a shift in the nature of work, from mass production, with stable customer requirements and slowly changing technology, to the current situation where every product or service may be supplied against a bespoke design, and technology changes continuously and rapidly. This modern environment is a more project-based economy. The management of the former situation was well understood, based on classical management theory, developed over the previous 100 years. Classical management offers the traditional organization many strengths derived from the functional hierarchy at its core. These include strong central planning, governance and control, knowledge management and human resource development. The project-based organization requires a new approach to its management, which addresses the unique, novel and transient nature of its work, but retains the strengths of classical management. This paper is one of a series aimed at deriving such a management paradigm for the project-based organization. In this paper, we describe governance structures adopted by successful project-based organizations, and how they use them to manage the interface between projects and their clients. We describe two roles observed at this interface, labelled the broker and steward. We provide a Transaction Cost perspective of the governance mechanisms observed and the two roles. We note that the same governance mechanisms are adopted whether the project is managed in the market or the hierarchy. This is in stark contrast to the classically managed organization, and suggests different pressures act on the project-based organization requiring hybrid governance structures to be adopted for all projects. We outline the roles of the broker and steward in the different project governance structures we have identified. We consider why it is necessary to have two roles, a broker and a steward, and not one person fulfilling both. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

@article{Seidel2013,
abstract = {Scholarly and practitioner literature have both described the potential benefits of using methods associated with a “design thinking” approach to develop new innovations. Most studies of the main design thinking methods—needfinding, brainstorming, and prototyping—are based either on analyses of experienced designers or examine each method in isolation. If design thinking is to be widely adopted, less-experienced users will employ these methods together, but we know little about their effect when newly adopted. Drawing on perspectives that consider concept development as broadly consisting of a divergent concept generation phase followed by a convergent concept selection phase, we collected data on 14 cases of novice multidisciplinary product development teams using design methods across both phases. Our hybrid qualitative and quantitative analysis indicate both benefits and limits of formal design methods: First, formal design methods were helpful not only during concept generation, but also during concept selection. Second, while brainstorming was valuable when combined with other methods, increased numbers of brainstorming sessions actually corresponded to lower performance, except in the setting where new members may join a team. And third, increased team reflexivity—such as from debating ideas, processes, or changes to concepts—was associated with more successful outcomes during concept generation but less successful outcomes during concept selection. We develop propositions related to the contingent use of brainstorming and team reflexivity depending on team composition and phase of development. Implications from this study include that novice multidisciplinary teams are more likely to be successful in applying design thinking when they can be guided to combine methods, are aware of the limits of brainstorming, and can transition from more- to less-reflexive practices.},

We argue that the “intellectual distance” between the knowledge embodied in research proposals and an evaluator's own expertise systematically relates to the evaluations given. To estimate relationships, we designed and executed a grant proposal process at a leading research university in which we randomized the assignment of evaluators and proposals to generate 2,130 evaluator–proposal pairs. We find that evaluators systematically give lower scores to research proposals that are closer to their own areas of expertise and to those that are highly novel. The patterns are consistent with biases associated with boundedly rational evaluation of new ideas. The patterns are inconsistent with intellectual distance simply contributing “noise” or being associated with private interests of evaluators.

In this article I explore some of the contradictions and tensions within a department where such a ‘hybrid' mode of control is implemented, embodying both bureaucratic and post-bureaucratic logics. In particular, I focus upon the discursive tactics employed to sell ‘rebureaucratization' as ‘debureaucratization', and the complex employee responses to this initiative.

A decision was made to reengineer a light commercial building 50 miles from the main research and development and manufacturing facility. This satellite facility that housed a supplier of electroformed parts to another original equipment manufacturer would need to be entirely retrofitted to accommodate the research and development and manufacturing requirements of the four groups. The existing corporate facilities engineering group was unable to deliver the array of request generated by the product development programs. This included 31 different projects, ranging from clean rooms and labs to air handling systems and offices. A project management team was spun off with the directive to meet customer requirements on time and within budget-even if it meant breaking rules. The project had many of the earmarks of a "skunkworks," the concept originally developed by Lockheed Martin, as a way to quickly develop solutions by bypassing some of the time-consuming bureaucracy and allowing the team to make ad hoc decisions. The skunkworks project management team was able to deliver the project on time and within budget by: (1) adhering to a clear focus on their mission; (2) including extensive up-front planning efforts; (3) critically analysing customer needs; (4) leveraging project overlaps; (5) involving suppliers early; (6) empowering the team; and (7) breaking rules. Many of the lessons learned from this project are being treated as organizational learning and are currently being incorporated into other facilities engineering groups to improve their operations.},

This study further examines how environmental aspects (i.e., dynamism and competitiveness) moderate the effectiveness of exploratory and exploitative innovation. Results indicate that centralization negatively affects exploratory innovation, whereas formalization positively influences exploitative innovation. Interestingly, connectedness within units appears to be an important antecedent of both exploratory and exploitative innovation. Furthermore, our findings reveal that pursuing exploratory innovation is more effective in dynamic environments, whereas pursuing exploitative innovation is more beneficial to a unit's financial performance in more competitive environments.

Analyzing three historical moments in design theory-building (the 1850s, with the ratio method for industrial upgrading in Germany; the 20th century with systematic design and the 1920s with the Bauhaus theory), we point to the dialectical interplay that links creativity and design theory, structured around the notion of "fixation effect": creativity identifies fixation effects, which become the targets of new design theories; design theories invent models of thought to overcome them; and, in turn, these design theories can also create new fixation effects that will then be designated by creativity studies. This dialectical interplay leads to regular inventions of new ways of managing design, ie new ways of managing knowledge, processes and organizations for design activities. We use this framework to analyze recent trends in creativity and design theories.},

This article analyses the emergence of the Renault–Nissan Alliance through the cooperative development of the first joint platform. In such collaborations, the relationships are as precarious as the potential synergies are uncertain. We argue that the building of a new collective identity requires specific managerial models to design simultaneously common purposes and collective identity. Several managerial implications are derived for inter-firm partnerships that aim at exploring new fields. But given the difficulties of managers, the paper also discusses possible legal implications and suggests a new type of contract, which would actually support the development of exploratory partnerships.},

abstract = {Technology entrepreneurship can be seen as building upon, while also deviating from, technological paths. Such deviation has primarily been described as singular events where individuals with prior knowledge discover a new opportunity. In this article, we will instead study deviation as a process of collective decision making, seen more as something mindful than singular. The purpose is to explore mindful deviation as decision making by nascent technology entrepreneurs as they conceptualize an early platform technology. Based on case assignments undertaken by 13 teams in a venture creation programme, C-K design theory is used to trace how nascent technology entrepreneurs in action combine causal and effectual decision-making logics. Individually answered questionnaires also offered insights into how the entrepreneurs perceived their decision making in hindsight. The findings break with our received wisdom around how opportunities are recognized as well as how effectual and causal logics occur. As a result, mindful deviation through combinations of effectual and causal logic is suggested as a means to understand early-stage technology entrepreneurship.},

abstract = {P revious research focuses on firm and business unit level ambidexterity. Therefore, conceptual and empirically validated understanding about ambidexterity at the individual level of analysis is very scarce. This paper addresses this gap in the literature by investigating managers' ambidexterity, delivering three contributions to theory and empirical research on ambidexterity: first, by proposing three related characteristics of ambidextrous managers; second, by developing a model and associated hypotheses on both the direct and interaction effects of formal structural and personal coordination mechanisms on managers' ambidexterity; and third, by testing the hypotheses based on a sample of 716 business unit level and operational level managers. Findings regarding the formal structural mechanisms indicate that a manager's decision-making authority positively relates to this manager's ambidexterity, whereas formalization of a manager's tasks has no significant relationship with this manager's ambidexterity. Regarding the personal coordination mechanisms, findings indicate that both the participation of a manager in cross-functional interfaces and the connectedness of a manager to other organization members positively relate to this manager's ambidexterity. Furthermore, results show positive interaction effects between the formal structural and personal coordination mechanisms on managers' ambidexterity. The paper's theoretical contributions and empirical results increase our understanding about managers' ambidexterity and about how different types and combinations of coordination mechanisms relate to variation in managers' ambidexterity},

abstract = {Radical product development projects, which are undertaken to create new categories of products, present significant challenges to development teams. In such settings existing formal processes may be limited or inappropriate, and objectives may be ambiguous and changing. The generation of a novel product concept early in the process can play an important role in guiding development teams, but the process by which teams later change concepts, as may be required within radical contexts, has merited further research. This study investigated how teams change novel product concepts after initial generation, employing an inductive case-study method drawing from 51 interviews with members of six radical development projects. The empirical results found that concepts were described in terms of concept components2014elemental descriptive forms that included verbal stories, verbal metaphors, and physical prototypes. When changes were required to concepts due to new technical or market information, rather than reconsider the overall concept through iteration to earlier product definition stages, teams shifted individual concept components, with a new component replacing a component of similar descriptive form. Over half of concept components observed across cases came after the initial generation of concepts in later elaboration and shifting. Contrary to expectations, development teams maintained reference not only to the revised concept but also to the deferred original concept. The case of a novel electronic book development project is used to illustrate the process, along with evidence of concept shifting across cases. The detailed findings expand our understanding of how formal processes may be augmented in radical innovation settings and how concepts are actually used by development teams in changing circumstances.},

Absorbed, generic resources are associated with increased exploitation and decreased exploration. Unabsorbed resources, both generic and rare, result in higher exploration and lower exploitation, but only when perceived environmental threat is high. Overall, results reveal pragmatic decision making balancing the benefits of superior strategic position against the risks of jeopardizing viability.},

abstract = {ME 313, Ambidextrous Thinking, was created in 1988 to meet the needs of incoming Masters degree students in the programs of Mechanical Design, Manufacturing Systems Engineering and Product Design. It serves as an introduction to the unique spirit and tradition of the Design Division of Stanford's Mechanical Engineering Department. It also serves as a test bed for the evolving design philosophy of the instructor who has spent over twenty years thinking about how to best foster creativity in the university setting. Encouraging experimentation and creativity utilizing engineering design projects is hopefully widespread. What is more likely to be considered unusual about this class is the efforts it makes to acquaint engineering graduate students with the full range of human potential in order to encourage a “whole person” approach to problem solving. This paper describes the background and underlying philosophy of the course, how it is structured, and, because it is pertinent, a description of how it is taught. Those areas which are perceived to be distinctive will be given more attention. These include the importance of freehand visualization, kinesthetic involvement, a teaching pedagogy which minimizes instruction in favor of action, and the lengths taken to encourage energetic involvement without using competition or grades as motivation.},

@book{Olson1971,
abstract = {This book develops an original theory of group and organizational behavior that cuts across disciplinary lines and illustrates the theory with empirical and historical studies of particular organizations. Applying economic analysis to the subjects of the political scientist, sociologist, and economist, Mancur Olson examines the extent to which the individuals that share a common interest find it in their individual interest to bear the costs of the organizational effort. The theory shows that most organizations produce what the economist calls “public goods”—goods or services that are available to every member, whether or not he has borne any of the costs of providing them. Economists have long understood that defense, law and order were public goods that could not be marketed to individuals, and that taxation was necessary. They have not, however, taken account of the fact that private as well as governmental organizations produce public goods. The services the labor union provides for the worker it represents, or the benefits a lobby obtains for the group it represents, are public goods: they automatically go to every individual in the group, whether or not he helped bear the costs. It follows that, just as governments require compulsory taxation, many large private organizations require special (and sometimes coercive) devices to obtain the resources they need. This is not true of smaller organizations for, as this book shows, small and large organizations support themselves in entirely different ways. The theory indicates that, though small groups can act to further their interest much more easily than large ones, they will tend to devote too few resources to the satisfaction of their common interests, and that there is a surprising tendency for the “lesser” members of the small group to exploit the “greater” members by making them bear a disproportionate share of the burden of any group action. All of the theory in the book is in Chapter 1; the remaining chapters contain empirical and historical evidence of the theory's relevance to labor unions, pressure groups, corporations, and Marxian class action},

abstract = {Most startups fail. But many of those failures are preventable. The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. Eric Ries defines a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business. The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on validated learning, rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute. Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before its too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever.},

abstract = {Designing incentive contracts that constructively guide employee efforts is a particularly difficult challenge in novel innovation initiatives, where unforeseen events may occur. Empirical studies have observed a variety of incentive structures in innovation settings: 'time and material contracts' (compensation for executing orders), 'downside protection' (target-driven incentives with protection from unexpected risks), and 'upside rewards' (additional remuneration for pursuing opportunities). This paper develops a model of incentives in presence of unforeseen events and offers a theoretical prediction of which of the empirically observed incentive structures should be used under which circumstances. The combination of three key influences drives the shape of the best incentive contract. First, the presence of unforeseeable uncertainty, or the occurrence of events that cannot possibly be foreseen at the outset. These may force a change in the project's plan, making pure target setting insufficient. Second, fairness concerns dictate that the employee's expected compensation cannot be shifted downward by unforeseen events, because it would cause demotivation, hostility, and defection. Third, management may not be able to observe the detailed actions of the employee (moral hazard) nor whether a positive or negative unforeseen event has occurred (asymmetric information).

abstract = {Problem-solving research and formal problem-solving practice begin with the assumption that a problem has been identified or formulated for solving. The problem-solving process then involves a search for a satisfactory or optimal solution to that problem. In contrast, we propose that, in informal problem solving, a need and a solution are often discovered together and tested for viability as a “need–solution pair.” For example, one may serendipitously discover a new solution and assess it to be worth adopting although the “problem” it would address had not previously been in mind as an object of search or even awareness. In such a case, problem identification and formulation, if done at all, come only after the discovery of the need–solution pair. We propose the identification of need–solution pairs as an approach to problem solving in which problem formulation is not required. We argue that discovery of viable need–solution pairs without problem formulation may have advantages over problem-initiated problem-solving methods under some conditions. First, it removes the often considerable costs associated with problem formulation. Second, it eliminates the constraints on possible solutions that any problem formulation will inevitably apply.},

It examines some complications in allocating resources between the two, particularly those introduced by the distribution of costs and benefits across time and space, and the effects of ecological interaction. Two general situations involving the development and use of knowledge in organizations are modeled. The first is the case of mutual learning between members of an organization and an organizational code. The second is the case of learning and competitive advantage in competition for primacy. The paper develops an argument that adaptive processes, by refining exploitation more rapidly than exploration, are likely to become effective in the short run but self-destructive in the long run. The possibility that certain common organizational practices ameliorate that tendency is assessed},

abstract = {In contrast to the punctuated equilibrium model of change, this inductive study of multiple-product innovation in six firms in the computer industry examines how organizations engage in continuous change. Comparisons of successful and less-successful firms show, first, that successful multiple-product in novation blends limited structure around responsibilities and priorities with extensive communication and design freedom to create improvisation within current projects. This combination is neither so structured that change cannot occur nor so unstructured that chaos ensues. Second, successful firms rely on a wide variety of low-cost probes into the future, including experimental products, futurists, and strategic alliances. Neither planning nor reacting is as effective. Third, successful firms link the present and future together through rhythmic, time-paced transition processes. We develop the ideas of "semistructures," "links in time," and "sequenced steps" to crystallize the key properties of these continuously changing organizations and to extend thinking about complexity theory, time-paced evolution, and the nature of core capabilities.

abstract = {Innovation received an important interest in the literature. Yet, research still seeks a better understanding of how to develop innovation capabilities in organizations. In this paper, we present an approach coming from deep qualitative studies in a few companies showing a rare capability to innovate repeatedly during several decades. In the paper we use two case studies to illustrate how these companies stimulate innovative design behavior in a sustainable way. They use existing knowledge to create new products and existing products to create new knowledge. They generate and combine lineages of products and lineages of knowledge. This behavior cannot be fully captured through the classic structural variables of organization theory. In addition, we need a framework coming from recent perspectives on design theory which define « design » as the dual generation of concepts (innovations) and knowledge (competencies). This framework offers an operational view on innovation. It emphasizes the notion of « design strategies » as guidelines both for knowledge creation and for structural dynamics. Classic notions like work division , functional structure, organic structures have to be revisited as they are not good descriptors of collective design processes. A new contingency approach of organizations is explored which predicts the emergence of « Design-oriented organizations » (DO2) as a new organizational model that fits correctly with our case studies. DO2 do not obey to a functional, matrix or network structure but to a design based developmental logic. Thus, the diffusion of successful and sustainable DO2 is a major institutional issue for contemporary global competition.},
