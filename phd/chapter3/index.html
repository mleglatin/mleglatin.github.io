            <p><em>In the fields of observation, chance favours only the prepared mind.</em><br>
<strong>Louis Pasteur</strong></p>
<p>In our literature review, we have taken sides with the critical approach
of stress testing a founding paper with evolutions of innovation
management, project management but also with refinements of generative
processes brought by design reasoning, theory and engineering design.</p>
<p>James March’s seed coming from problem-solving (March

<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>), has spread from a concern of organizational
learning developing an adaptive model to being the fertile ground for
ambidexterity and innovation. The dichotomy operated between exploration
and exploitation regimes has fed numerous studies, with more emphasis on
the role of exploration, and confusion around what embodies really this
two constructs. The articles (Birkinshaw and Gupta

<a href="#ref-Birkinshaw2013">2013</a>; Gupta, Smith, and Shalley

<a href="#ref-Gupta2006">2006</a>) were critical in discussing the non-mutual
conditioning of exploration/exploitation as introduced by (March

<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>). They sketched the idea that the divide between
these two may have changed in nature. They also encourage to think of it
on two separate dimensions and avoid only considering it as two ends on
a same continuum.</p>
<p>In less than 30 years and approximately 20,000 citations, the adaptive
process of organizational learning rooted in a search-based model of
problem solving has been largely superseded with what innovation
management has become and its diverse approaches. The models, we have
studied based on the literature review address part of these evolutions
whilst still being all equally present in research and practice.</p>
<p>We have taken a stance regarding how generative processes challenge
exploration vs. exploitation and see how they contribute to models of
ambidexterity and how they are encapsulated in different modes of
collective action such as project management. The notion of exploration
is quite pervasive, and usually aims at supporting sustainable
innovation. However, by considering input from design theory and
reasoning, we have shown the numerous limitations, tensions left to how
coordination and collective action should be conducted. For example,
when considering the biology metaphors used in the literature and
introduced in the review: adaptive evolution calls for mutation and
selection, interactions call for an ecology of generativity,
encapsulation in projects may lead to epicormic shoots at odds with
organization design. The latter allowed questioning the nature and the
management of organizational metabolism.</p>
<p>The management load comes then in different ways for leadership, or top
management, middle management and agents, and raises in complexity when
dealing with the loci and nature of generativity. Management
prescriptions have had the tendency to call for advanced
decision-making, cognition and action.</p>
<p>As these three pivoting dimensions are quite recurrent, we propose to
have an enlarged vision of decision-making. Inspired by the neo-Carnegie
research agenda (Gavetti, Levinthal, and Ocasio

<a href="#ref-Gavetti2007">2007</a>, 531), we propose to stick with foundations
&ldquo;<em>behaviorally plausible, decision-centred perspective on
organizations</em>&quot;. The stress test driven by design reasoning and theory
will support such effort. The research program tailored at Centre for
Scientific Management in Mines ParisTech started off from a former
tradition of studying implementation and performativity of operational
research tools and methods (Segrestin et al.

<a href="#ref-Segrestin2017">2017</a>). Later, it constituted itself as an
extension of H.Simon’s work: design theory and expandable rationality
(Hatchuel 
<a href="#ref-Hatchuel2001a">2001</a>). Our literature review at least
brings forward the originality of looping back with origins and more
‘traditional’ management issues as design theory and innovation
management have constituted its own path.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>We propose to first clarify the models of ambidexterity and management
of the unknown studied in our literature review with the following
descriptors: model of coordination and collective action and the
innovation potential of attraction covering the nature of generative
processes, environment cognition and organization design.</p>
<p>These description elements will help us formulating our research
questions and preliminary hypotheses to set a course for the methodology
part and results.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<hr>
<h2 id="model-description-categories">Model description categories</h2>
<p>First of all, we should start by clarifying the descriptors enabling a
clearer comparison between models as these were introduced all along the
literature review. We had started from James March’s seminal paper
(March 
<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>) and methodological literature review
(Wilden et al. 
<a href="#ref-Wilden2018">2018</a>) with a concern for
organizational learning, rationality and foolishness, and its
contribution to innovation management. Diving into the literature of
ambidexterity allowed giving another flavour to the dichotomy of
exploration/exploitation with some concern for organization design,
resource allocation, dynamic capabilities and paradoxes. As the question
of implementing ambidextrous organization and prescribing sometimes
heavily contingent recommendations, we proposed to look at the
decision-making and the contributions from generative processes
challenges. The second chapter, studied the projectification of the
economy and how innovation management could be encapsulated. Embedding
generative processes in the case of exploration-dedicated project,
raised numerous questions on the organization hosting such projects,
reconsidering the matrix and organic forms. Finally, the associated
organization design and decisions to be made accordingly permit
rethinking the environmental and cognitive fits in cope with change.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>Another approach to our literature review and derived models would be
then to identify what are the designated <strong>models of collective
action</strong>. In other words, it is the way in which the models are
prescribed and translated into managerial action. It embeds several
hypotheses and sets a manageable course of action. The second dimension
to medidate - due to the complexity induced by potentially distributed
generative processes across the firm and organization structures - would
be the <strong>innovation potential of attraction</strong>. We suggest to break it
down in three. The first sub-category concerns <strong>generative processes</strong>
and their ‘performance’. The latter cannot be fully isolated per se as
it has been extensively discussed throughout the literature review, we
propose to consider the second category: <strong>environment cognition</strong>. And
finally, the last sub-category is the organization design. The concern
for attraction is inspired by complexity theory in the sense that
‘chaos’ can temporarily ‘organize’ itself around
near-point-of-equilibrium. Consequently, it allows us to add a concern
for how standalone generative practices will engage with the environment
and simultaneously mirror what is necessary in the <strong>organization
design</strong> to support its own generativity.</p>
<p>In the same vein of the two previous chapters, we propose to picture our
dimensions and sub-categories by considering their ‘edges’ revealed by
the challenges sustained by the unknown and its management. It
delimitates the three models on those edges, which have been pointed out
by the stress test of design theories against innovation management,
organization studies and project management.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="model-of-collective-action">Model of collective action</h3>
<p>All of the research discussed in the literature review addressed in some
way how action should be carried out to support their model. Sometimes,
the recommendation was quite ‘meta’ allowing it to be transferrable to
different research domains, sometimes it was more centred on the agent
(decisions, responsibility, cognition, relationships) and in other cases
it was quite abstract with constructs such as dynamic capabilities.</p>
<p>The loci of generative processes and their organization is depicted in
the way individuals, teams and organizations will contribute and
interfere with it. The drive and control of such generative forces is
placed on different management tools and individuals. The effort is
placed on the relationships and knowledge interplay (Hatchuel

<a href="#ref-Hatchuel2011b">2011</a>; Segrestin et al.

<a href="#ref-Segrestin2017">2017</a>).</p>
<h3 id="innovation-potential-of-attraction">Innovation potential of attraction</h3>
<p>The innovation potential of attraction will be constituted by different
sub-categories contributing at different levels of the firm: individual,
technical, systemic, social and organizational.</p>
<h4 id="generative-process">Generative process</h4>
<p>The generative processes come in different practices, more or less
formalized or even institutionalized. They have different generative
engine, leading action in different directions and contributing to the
valuation process in different ways. The innovation potential will come
from the novelty, the fluency and also defixation power (Smith, Ward,
and Schumacher 
<a href="#ref-Smith1993">1993</a>; Ward 
<a href="#ref-Ward2007">2007</a>,

<a href="#ref-Ward1994">1994</a>; Agogué, Le Masson, and Robinson

<a href="#ref-Agogue2012a">2012</a>; Le Masson, Hatchuel, and Weil

<a href="#ref-LeMasson2011">2011</a>; Houdé 
<a href="#ref-Houde1997">1997</a>). The attraction
comes from the way in which a group of individual participate to the
joint generative effort.</p>
<p>It is also crucial to understand the nature of fixation effects and
interdependencies addressed, and of course what is taken for granted in
the exploration process. The behavioural aspect appears critical as it
involves what bounds rationality, and what can expand it, and the tools
and methods used to support such constraint or effort. Specification of
mental models and performance beliefs to drive generativity will be key
as they address potential <em>epistemic interdependencies</em> (Puranam,
Raveendran, and Knudsen 
<a href="#ref-Puranam2012a">2012</a>).</p>
<h4 id="environment-cognition">Environment cognition</h4>
<p>The environment cognition relates to the generative processes locus and
its engagement into its environment. It considers mainly how the system
is shaped and how it regards its own extension with ‘environment’.
Different devices and mechanisms can be imagined to prepare for
uncertainty and the unknown.</p>
<p>Not only it targets the perception and decisions made to cope with the
environment, but also how action occurs purely as a means to engage with
the environment and deal with uncertainties and the unknown. The
<em>cognitive fit</em> with elaboration of mental models will support the
appropriate <em>environmental fit</em> (Martignoni, Menon, and Siggelkow

<a href="#ref-Martignoni2016">2016</a>; Posen and Levinthal

<a href="#ref-Posen2012">2012</a>). The innovation potential of attraction will be
supported by how the system’s extension into the environment is managed
through the generative process, implying some level of awareness that is
taken into account by different individuals (agents, middle/top
management).</p>
<h4 id="organization-design">Organization design</h4>
<p>Organization design was addressed in different ways in our literature
review. The forms adopted by the firm were seen as important to support
generative processes but it is also key to understand what contributes
to the implementation of outputs. Moreover the beliefs and alternatives
supporting the organization designs will be closely to product
development with the <em>mirroring hypothesis</em> in mind.</p>
<p>As the organization design is supposed to be the result of a change to
better respond to the environment, this potential never-ending process
for turbulent and complex environment calls for a certain <em>generative
fit</em> by opposition to the traditional <em>organizational fit</em> (Avital and
Te’eni 
<a href="#ref-Avital2009">2009</a>; Van de Ven, Ganco, and Hinings

<a href="#ref-VandeVen2013">2013</a>). The innovation potential of attraction here
is then expressed by considering what make the structures to reshape
around a proposed or even sketched new organizational design.</p>
<p>Overall, the organization design will support the generative processes,
engaging with environment if they metabolize through structure and
processes of the organization. Relationships and knowledge will
dynamically evolve in parallel.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="research-questions-and-preliminary-hypothesis">Research questions and preliminary hypothesis</h2>
<p>The portrait made with our descriptors and models drawn from the
literature review reveal the assumptions made by these and their
potential limitations. These mainly appear since we tasked ourselves to
use design theory and reasoning to stress test several foundational
approaches made at the edge of the literature in innovation management,
organization theory and project management.</p>
<p>First, we propose to address that the fact that the original construct
of balancing of exploration/exploitation may have suffered to a point
where ambidexterity could severely jeopardize innovation management
(Birkinshaw and Gupta 
<a href="#ref-Birkinshaw2013">2013</a>; Wilden et al.

<a href="#ref-Wilden2018">2018</a>; Gupta, Smith, and Shalley

<a href="#ref-Gupta2006">2006</a>). Such perspective is also valid for project
management as the tension of exploration/exploitation typifies the
nature and course of action of projects in the firm, and the associated
temporary organization (Lenfle 
<a href="#ref-Lenfle2016">2016</a>).</p>
<p>Second, it is almost unthinkable to fully discard such concept. So, we
propose to revisit the notion of adaptive process, along with
interactive and encapsulated models, at the light of generative
processes. We should, in a way, reconsider nuances between exploration
and exploitation, their definitions to regenerate ambidexterity
behaviour across the firm (cognition, product development, project) and
ambidextrous organization. More specifically, the relationship between
product design and organization design (Colfer and Baldwin

<a href="#ref-Colfer2016">2016</a>), and the importance of <em>epistemic
interdependencies</em> could reveal ways of properly overcoming and managing
organization design fixations, thus enabling the hybridisation of
project and change management.</p>
<p>Third, if we manage to regenerate such construct with the fresh
teachings of design theory and reasoning, we should of course be able to
validate it. We should then also specify the new regime of collective
action supporting it.</p>
<p>Based on the descriptors and the projection of our three models derived
from the literature, we can identify several areas of commonalities. The
dichotomy is usually enforced between exploration and exploitation, with
of course, different value frames and performances. These modulations
emphasize the paradox of dealing with both no matter the unit of
analysis (middle/top management, organization design, project,
resources, routines, etc.). There is a <strong>non-mutual conditioning between
exploration and exploitation</strong> presented across the literature streams.</p>
<p>For instance, as exploitation picturing bounded rationality, exploration
could be driven by foolishness or irrationality. Chaos could then
perhaps provide some input for exploitation, but the role of
exploitation providing some grounds for exploration is rarely, if not
never, discussed (Wilden et al. 
<a href="#ref-Wilden2018">2018</a>). Only James
March sketched a possibility of nuancing the dichotomy (March

<a href="#ref-March2006">2006</a>, 209)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It is argued that the link between rationality and conventional
knowledge keeps rational technologies reliable but inhibits creative
imagination. This characterization seems plausible, but it probably
underestimates the potential contribution of rational technologies to
foolishness and radical visions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such cleavage is also enforced in the nature of project management for
exploration and the required organizational ties. Interactionism blurs
the dichotomy but instead raises numerous questions on the management
and control of organization design, identity and change direction.</p>
<p>In order to sum up, we propose to define a common model of non-mutual
conditioning between exploration and exploitation regimes. It is
declined over the four descriptors introduced earlier.</p>
<p>The innovation potential of attraction specify the non-mutuality between
the product design and development for radical innovation and
organization design. The mirroring hypothesis pictured a static view of
the mutuality, but we are interested in the change process.</p>
<p>Despite the interactionist perspective stressing the reciprocity
sustained through circulation of concepts, the emergent nature of value,
recombination of routines, the role of artefacts and metaphors, it is
not very clear how the managerial action is achieved to balance and
control design fixations and epistemic interdependencies. Especially,
they don’t necessarily review the separation of both regimes and how it
could be articulated differently. So there is also a non-mutual
conditioning of coordination and collective action across the different
level of analysis.</p>

<h3 id="rq1-how-does-the-dichotomy-between-explorationexploitation-compromise-sustained-innovation">RQ1: How does the dichotomy between exploration/exploitation compromise sustained innovation?</h3>
<p>First of all, the difficulties raised by generative processes
challenging organizational forms and action regimes supporting
innovation, encourage us to specify: <strong>What are the characteristics of
exploration project management floating between intra-organization and
inter-organization settings?</strong> It appears crucial to understand the
underlying mechanisms and tension points where generativity strikes
against organization boundaries and rules. Our interest is in linking
the design theories and product development with such concern to
contribute to questions raised in the literature (Gavetti, Levinthal,
and Ocasio 
<a href="#ref-Gavetti2007">2007</a>, 532):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>how organizational rules and routines interact with formal and
informal decision-making structures is an important unanswered
question that must be answered to develop a more integrated theory of
organizations</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to the separation operated by exploration and exploitation to
support organizational learning, and limitations addressed by
interactionist and project management literature, the construct of
ambidexterity may have been outdated by practices and literature
refinements in innovation management: <strong>Does the dichotomy of
exploration/exploitation jeopardize innovation management at the light
of generative processes?</strong><br>
As suggested in the literature, nuances could be disentangled between
the exploration and exploitation regimes, so we could ask ourselves:
<strong>How generative processes contribute to exploration struggle with
exploitation constraints (design rules, fixation effects,
interdependencies)?</strong><br>
Finally we can summarize our first target into:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How does the dichotomy between
exploration/exploitation compromise sustained innovation?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>As the reader can guess, we propose to reveal a management anomaly with
respect to predictions of the literature models of ambidexterity. The
prescribed non-mutual conditioning between exploration and exploitation
clashes with generative processes specifically targeting the unknown.
Exploration projects have a means to encapsulate the management of the
unknown, and consequently drive innovation, but they can fail in the
long run because of ambidextrous organizations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, organizations design as well product engineering fixations
are not fully overcome through exploration project management nor
ambidexterity itself.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="rq2-what-model-of-ambidexterity-can-be-designed-to-overcome-and-manage-organization-design-fixations">RQ2: What model of ambidexterity can be designed to overcome and manage organization design fixations?</h3>
<p>If exploration/exploitation dichotomy’s construct could actually kill
innovation, we need to tackle the underlying behavioural foundations in
order to disentangle associated difficulties. A first hint would be to
deeply revisit the way decision-making is constructed due to the
interference of generative processes supported by design reasoning and
theory.</p>
<p>Several rules, fixation effects and <strong>epistemic interdependencies</strong>,
which are representative of formal and informal patterns of
exploitation, could be directly addressed by exploration activities.
More precisely, they could be among the requirements and be the purpose
of generative processes to sustain innovation in the firm.<strong>How could
organization design and change be simultaneously managed along a radical
innovation project?</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>environment cognition</strong> and the associated (mirrored)
<strong>organization design</strong> bearing new product development projects reveal
their design rules, fixation effects when challenged by generative
processes. The <strong>ecology of concepts</strong>, <strong>organization mutations</strong> and
<strong>epicormic shoots</strong> triggered and challenged by exploration activities
as knowledge-interactions dynamics are constantly strained (Hatchuel

<a href="#ref-Hatchuel2011b">2011</a>): <strong>How does it metabolize with innovative
design, organizational concerns and strategy?</strong></p>
<p>We propose then to synthesize these questions and first assumptions
into:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How can ambidexterity be revisited to overcome and manage organization design fixations?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>By opposition with anomalies, we naturally explore what the mutual
conditioning between exploration and exploitation can bring to
exploration project management. The underlying problem-solving
foundation will be revisited by design theories, where the unknown is
its second core after knowledge, will help revealing so far hidden
variables. Rooting decision-design on fixations and interdependencies
will facilitate generation of alternatives and concepts. Such generation
will then effectively work on product design and organization design.</p>
<p>This modelling effort will necessarily require testing with further case
studies but also experimentation. Given their context, the researcher’s
intervention, where generativity is driven be decision-design, will
raise several questions on contingent organizational routines, dynamic
capabilities, as well as interactions and reconfigurations supporting
organizational change.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="rq3-how-can-intrainter-bu-exploration-projects-be-metabolized-in-the-organization-to-support-radical-innovation-for-the-conglomerate">RQ3: How can intra/inter-BU exploration projects be metabolized in the organization to support radical innovation for the conglomerate?</h3>
<p>The previous two questions encouraged the detection of an anomaly in the
practice of innovation management and the design of a new model
reconfiguring and extending the domain of validity of the ambidexterity
construct. We consequently need to think of the managerial action of the
new model.</p>
<p>Since, we will propose to root our research in the field offered by a
conglomerate of SMEs evolving the aircraft equipment market (Zodiac
Aerospace), we propose to emphasize the organization design and
behavioural approaches arising from the inter-organizational
relationships. Thus, it heavily challenges the edges of interactive and
encapsulated models, as organization structures tend to be the
by-product of product development.</p>
<p>Finally, our last research question can be summarized into:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How can intra/inter-BU exploration projects be metabolized in the organization to support radical innovation for the conglomerate?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    Following the modelling effort, the associated testing and intervention,
provide means of actions to work (organization &amp; product) design
fixations to surface interdependencies. Disentangling such knots offer a
new lens driving organization change and product innovation. New
interactions are created and routines are recombined through the
generation of alternatives and concepts relying conditioned by
exploitation. Overall, these dynamics contribute to organizational
metabolisms.
