            <p><em>Unitas multiplex: l’unité de, dans la diversité.</em><br>
<em>La Méthode: La Nature de la nature</em>, <strong>Edgar Morin</strong></p>
<p>In the previous chapter we have exposed models of ambidexterity. We have
insisted on the role of ambidexterity and how it would rely of adaptive
and interactive processes. Both of these play with an agent-based and
socio-organizational views of the firm to sustain organizational
learning. They contribute to the balancing of exploration/exploitation
by offering room for generative processes.</p>
<p>Generativity, an engine of innovation, will shift the performance
frontier of exploration and exploitation. The adaptation relies more on
the constructs of exploration/exploitation and a linear perspective of
innovation. Whereas, the interactionism brings a networking perspective
whilst stressing the emergent nature of generative processes through
creation of meaning and sensemaking. Both place a different emphasis on
decision-making organizing collective action in the firm. However, as we
stressed the invasive role of the unknown through innovation management,
the assumption of separating and balancing exploration vs. exploitation
may be shattered.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we propose to tackle another action mode where the
unknown occupies a key place. It is less linear or distributed that the
previous models of ambidexterity. Seen from the firm level and system
level, it is <strong>encapsulated</strong>. We will consider the literature on
project management through the lens of researchers who rethink project
management as practice reveals new challenges (Svejvig and Andersen

<a href="#ref-Svejvig2015">2015</a>) which also lead to critical management studies
(Cicmil and Hodgson 
<a href="#ref-Cicmil2006">2006</a>).</p>
<p>Projects are seen as appropriate devices to cope with turbulent
environments (Ekstedt et al. 
<a href="#ref-Ekstedt1999">1999</a>), they can also
stimulate learning and creativity to support complex products
development (Hobday 
<a href="#ref-Hobday2000">2000</a>), and the project-based
organization is regarded as efficient for information sharing and
knowledge management (Silver 
<a href="#ref-Silver2000">2000</a>; DeFillippi

<a href="#ref-DeFillippi2001">2001</a>). It is even more important to deal with the
notion of projects as they have been institutionalized extensively in
firms through the Project Management Institute and the Project
Management Book along with certification for practitioners. Overall, it
makes of project management a stimulating candidate to perform
ambidexterity.</p>
<p>Our concern is what happens when these projects and its management try
to shape the unknown, specially because it has this encapsulated mode of
dealing with exploitation and exploration. We are then more inclined at
looking at the adaptive mode of project management rather than
optimizing models for projects (Davies, Manning, and Söderlund

<a href="#ref-Davies2018">2018</a>). However, we still see how the fields of
innovation and project management could be cross fertilized at little
further at the light of generative processes and managing the unknown.</p>

<p>It is largely established that institutionalized project management
comes with a certain faith in instrumental rationality, objectivity,
reductionism and expectations of universal validity (Ika and Hodgson

<a href="#ref-Ika2014">2014</a>; Cicmil and Hodgson 
<a href="#ref-Cicmil2006">2006</a>, 1182).
Traditional projects are framed, needs and requirements are captured
into objectives allowing to breakdown the project into work packages and
tasks. Usually, these are mirrored by an organization (<em>work breakdown
organization</em>). Gates track the progress against criteria agreed upon
from the beginning or by mimicry in-between them. The strongest
assumption is that the course of action is driven by risk management
(risk registers) and uncertainty reduction towards the objective. Change
control boards are used to deal with several uncertainties or additional
demands.</p>
<p>However, most of choices and states of nature are known and usually
uncertain. It is largely the case of (new) product development process.
Several fallacies are known already (Thomke and Reinertsen

<a href="#ref-Thomke2012">2012</a>) revealing some of the dangerous rational myths
behind project management (Boxenbaum and Jonsson

<a href="#ref-Boxenbaum2017">2017</a>). Of course, several add-ons were made to the
traditional project management methodology (waterfall model): scrum and
agility (Takeuchi and Nonaka 
<a href="#ref-Takeuchi1986">1986</a>) or diamond
approach to deal with contingency, novelty and complexity (Shenhar and
Dvir 
<a href="#ref-Shenhar2007">2007</a>). As several schools of thoughts
(Söderlund 
<a href="#ref-Soderlund2011">2011</a>) can be found in project
management, we propose to focus our discussion on the tension with
innovation management. We will tend to fit with this line of thought as
it considers the association of strategic management with the launch of
exploration project by firms. In other words, it contributes to firm’s
survival and performance.</p>
<p>Finding articles and books that openly discuss the place of the unknown
in management is a complicated task. There are very few publications on
the topic, usually the word has a secondary position leaving on the
front seat other keywords such as innovation, radical innovation,
entrepreneurship or simply high uncertainty or at best unforeseeable
uncertainty. We will leave aside the notion such as unexpected or
surprise as we are concerned by the deliberate action of heading into
the unknown for a desirable future. In (Svejvig and Andersen

<a href="#ref-Svejvig2015">2015</a>), we would fit in the category of <em>Complexity
and Uncertainty</em> and <em>Broader Conceptualization</em>, which necessarily
echoes the contingency, behavioural and decision schools of thought as
we have been developing an interest for neighbouring research
discipline: innovation management. As explained in a recent and critical
literature review (Davies, Manning, and Söderlund

<a href="#ref-Davies2018">2018</a>), these two disciplines have evolved over
decades and they explain why/how these two have failed to learn from
each other. We propose to follow this path and bring additional light to
these teachings with the question of managing the unknown through
project management.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    In this first subsection, we will address the issue of project
management facing high uncertainty or dealing with the unknown. We will
then characterize the features of such management with respect to the
host organization and finally how it deals with generative processes.

<h3 id="exploration-project-organizational-oddity">Exploration project: organizational oddity</h3>
<p>As stated previously, we are interested in discussing at the edge of
project management and innovation research: exploration project (Lenfle

<a href="#ref-Lenfle2008">2008</a>). They differ and destabilize the optimizing
model of traditional <em>plan and execute</em> that one could see in
development processes. It cannot also be reduced to an adaptive model as
presented in the previous chapter. It embeds features that call for
proactivity. Several principles are defined to support his new project
category:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The need to set up a specific entity to manage the exploration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The emphasis on the central role of tests (prototypes, testing,
customer trials, etc.) in the management process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The emphasis on the need for concurrent exploration which must
concern both concepts and knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The management process must take into account these two different
dimensions of performance: the value of the products and accumulated
knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The management tools used must allow a reformulation of the
objectives along the way</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As we can see, some features are derived from adaptive models inspired
by contingency theory (Shenhar and Dvir 
<a href="#ref-Shenhar2007">2007</a>) but it
brings insight from innovation management that call for a mode of action
continuously shifting (Brown and Eisenhardt 
<a href="#ref-Brown1997">1997</a>). It
also relies on innovative design practices (Hatchuel et al.

<a href="#ref-Hatchuel2010">2010</a>; Le Masson, Weil, and Hatchuel

<a href="#ref-LeMasson2017">2017</a>, 
<a href="#ref-LeMasson2010">2010</a>). By developing
this experiential approach (Eisenhardt and Tabrizi

<a href="#ref-Eisenhardt1995">1995</a>) and based on the works of (Loch, Meyer, and
Pich 
<a href="#ref-Loch2006">2006</a>), the exploration strategy consists in
multiplying probe and learn steps, the projects outcomes are hard to
grasp as the action mode challenges heavily optimization and adaptive
model. Trial and error can be complemented by selectionism. Careful
balance of these two strategies may contribute to overall performance
depending on complexity and unforeseeable uncertainty (Sommer and Loch

<a href="#ref-Sommer2004">2004</a>).</p>
<p>The distancing of the projects can be seen as an organization oddity
(Lenfle 
<a href="#ref-Lenfle2016">2016</a>). The author proposed that with the
support of design theories and design management, the concurrent
exploration of knowledge and concepts could help support the project
variables: objectives, risks, capabilities to be developed. Projects are
indeed very stimulating loci where technology and system meet knowledge
management (Silver 
<a href="#ref-Silver2000">2000</a>) thus bearing critical
capabilities for the firm. As these are used as experiments in its
broadest sense (Thomke 
<a href="#ref-Thomke2003">2003</a>), they can also absorb
shocks and risks that a traditional new product development process
wouldn’t (Brown and Eisenhardt 
<a href="#ref-Brown1997">1997</a>). Yet, the
strangeness of the project requires careful management of the unknown
dimensions of the project: e.g. potential organizational ties through
communities contingent to the expansion made into the unknown.<br>
In the field of innovation management, we could not avoid the works of
Gina O’Connor (O’Connor 
<a href="#ref-OConnor2016">2016</a>)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. First of all, in
this literature, projects are seen as devices for innovation, and they
usually are synonymous with product development. Using them as unit of
analysis, project timelines are made to articulate the link with
breakthrough innovation.</p>
<p>Exploration is the centre of attention, and emphasis is put on the
actual creation process (path creation, regenerative dynamic
capabilities (Ambrosini, Bowman, and Collier

<a href="#ref-Ambrosini2009">2009</a>)). As for the previously quoted works and
others (Maniak, Midler, and Lenfle 
<a href="#ref-Maniak2007a">2007</a>; Beaume,
Maniak, and Midler 
<a href="#ref-Beaume2009">2009</a>), the organizational ties are
not discussed in much depth despite the strategic dimension of these
projects heavily challenging functions of existing products (concepts
and knowledge). For example, the rich longitudinal studies (O’Connor

<a href="#ref-OConnor2016">2016</a>) show how the projects are hosted by several
business units or departments, and sometimes, end up establishing a
proper entity on its own. To counter ad-hoc behaviours, she calls then,
beyond the necessary support of top management during the exploration
process, for a proper institutionalisation thus avoiding only relying on
innovation champions.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>Exploration project may have the tendency to float across organizations
as they encapsulate several innovative practices challenging
exploitation. They bring new experiences, they engage in action, which
potentially allows pushing the performance frontier of exploration. It
does contribute to ambidexterity with antagonistic effects for
exploitation certainties: evaluation of objectives, contributing teams
and resources and established knowledge.</p>
<p>Before coming back to the organizational and institutional issue, we
would like to focus on the mechanisms that potential regenerative
dynamic capabilities should address as the exploration projects glide
across an organization in the hope for a landing field so they can
actually plan the plan and execute the plan.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="difficulty-of-transitioning">Difficulty of transitioning</h3>
<p>The contingency stressed in the work of Sylvain Lenfle and Christoph
Loch can be confirmed through several other works presented in a special
issue (Midler, Killen, and Kock 
<a href="#ref-Midler2016">2016</a>). It reinforces
the perspective that traditional optimizing models are insufficient for
innovation (Davies, Manning, and Söderlund 
<a href="#ref-Davies2018">2018</a>).
Contextuality is necessary to understand the complexities, the successes
and the failures of projects. For instance in (Akkermans and Oorschot

<a href="#ref-Akkermans2016">2016</a>), they explain how small feedback loops
between project phases and concurrency (Maniak et al.

<a href="#ref-Maniak2008">2008</a>) can reduce risks and delays. The importance of
coordination is also stressed in the alleged decision gate in product
development (Christiansen and Varnes 
<a href="#ref-Christiansen2007">2007</a>)
where stakeholders are rather networking instead of making decisions.<br>
However, numerous practices and myopic behaviours can be found like in
the case of mega projects. Their fragility (Ansar et al.

<a href="#ref-Ansar2016">2017</a>) show the absence of learning on the methods and
tools used to conduct such large projects. Stage-gate mode also tend to
fail quite too often when following the iron triangle of Quality Cost
and Delay of standard project management (Sethi and Iqbal

<a href="#ref-Sethi2008">2008</a>). This encourages to rethink constantly what
makes the performance of the project, the evaluation criteria used along
the trajectory as it was stressed in (Lenfle 
<a href="#ref-Lenfle2008">2008</a>,

<a href="#ref-Lenfle2016">2016</a>). The same authors also through a tremendous
historical effort on project management insisted that originally the
root of project management (Lenfle and Loch 
<a href="#ref-Lenfle2010">2010</a>,

<a href="#ref-Lenfle2017">2017</a>) where closer to innovation management as also
stressed by (Davies, Manning, and Söderlund 
<a href="#ref-Davies2018">2018</a>). So
the notion of failure against an optimizing framework, which is also the
exploitative regime discussed in the previous chapter, encourage the
re-articulation of the performance for exploration projects (Elmquist
and Le Masson 
<a href="#ref-Elmquist2009">2009</a>).<br>
As the innovation management research has (mainly) developed the
adaptive model with respect to project management, the over-emphasis on
these models had a tendency of not considering enough optimizing
&ldquo;constraints&rdquo; such as planning, execution and exploitation.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> It is
then key to understand how the contingency is managed but also how this
distance is engineered within projects and by stakeholders or the
projects’ governance.<br>
Several hints can be found in the literature such as: sensemaking of
risky and loss of control (Iacovou and Dexter 
<a href="#ref-Iacovou2004">2004</a>),
terminating projects (Green, Welsh, and Dehler 
<a href="#ref-Green2003">2003</a>),
modelling with real options theory (Lint and Pennings

<a href="#ref-Lint2001">2001</a>), also mapping risk-tolerance (Kwak and LaPlace

<a href="#ref-Kwak2005">2005</a>) and escalating commitment relative to the project
(Ross and Staw 
<a href="#ref-Ross1993">1993</a>). The encapsulated model of
managing the unknown and dealing with risks and uncertainty, as a
vehicle for innovation, continuously defy the working reference for the
host firm. As the practice shows, shifts are made and references are
made against the original concepts as shown in (Seidel

<a href="#ref-Seidel2007">2007</a>) across multiple contexts.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>For an exploration project to find a landing spot we see the constant
performance re-evaluation challenges and stress test against
exploitation constraints. The problem can also be turned upside down by
ensuring the existence of large net to catch the exploration effort and
make sense of it. They may have learning and adaptive mechanisms
differing the rest of the organization (Lundin and Midler
<a href="#ref-Lundin1998">1998</a>), or expecting to have a full projet-based
organization. So, what are then the underlying mechanisms that drive
expansions in project’s scope? Is there a way directing it and
control/measure a <em>distance</em> with respect to exploitation ?</p>
<p>These are very <em>engineering-oriented</em> questions but we force these
questions as it has been stressed that the models of ambidexterity have
enforced the non-mutual conditioning between exploration and
exploitation. So coming from the project management perspective, and its
encapsulation mode, we propose to study if ambidexterity is discussed
differently given evolutions of innovation management.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="generative-processes-in-project-management">Generative processes in project management?</h3>
<p>Since we are focused on innovation management and project management as
they contribute to separation of exploration and exploitation, we
propose to discuss the underlying mechanisms driving the exploration
effort: mainly generative processes.</p>
<p>Design theories and design management have been solicited by researchers
already (Lenfle 
<a href="#ref-Lenfle2016">2016</a>) for instance, and (O’Connor

<a href="#ref-OConnor2016">2016</a>) refers to the management concept of
&ldquo;regenerative&rdquo; dynamic capabilities developed by (Ambrosini, Bowman, and
Collier 
<a href="#ref-Ambrosini2009">2009</a>). In the behavioural school
(Söderlund 
<a href="#ref-Soderlund2011">2011</a>), the place of creativity is
discussed in several contributions, but still remains secondary compared
to other aspects of project management. Our focus is not specially on
notions such as creative climate, even though it may contribute
positively to the project conduct, specially compared to tools and
frameworks induced by management theories aiming at reducing variation
(Ekvall 
<a href="#ref-Ekvall1993">1993</a>, 
<a href="#ref-Ekvall2000">2000</a>). We are rather
interested on the actual creative process and methods that we tasked to
label in its weaker form: generativity.</p>
<p>In (Harrison and Rouse 
<a href="#ref-Harrison2015">2015</a>), feedback sessions in
creative projects (industrial design and modern dance) reveal several
moves used by designers and feedback providers. The feedback provided
two kind of signals: <em>excavations</em> and <em>adjustments</em>. It thus fed an
adaptive mode for designers to bring back previous concepts and
refinements to the prototypes. Such approach calls for a deeper value
management in the spirit of what was discussed in the previous chapter
on how to formalize design practices. For instance, (Gillier, Hooge, and
Piat 
<a href="#ref-Gillier2015">2015</a>) manage the value exploration and measure
the &ldquo;distance&rdquo; of the concept shift and novel knowledge (Seidel

<a href="#ref-Seidel2007">2007</a>). In the same vein, cases of exploration project
management show how to build legitimacy around novelty with stakeholders
(Hooge and Dalmasso 
<a href="#ref-Hooge2015">2015</a>) and management value
creation and value realization (R. Maniak et al.

<a href="#ref-Maniak2014">2014</a>). Design Thinking was proposed to be blended
with project management to enhance value and change management (Ben
Mahmoud-Jouini, Midler, and Silberzahn

<a href="#ref-BenMahmoud-Jouini2016">2016</a>). All of these approaches bring
additional depth to the interactive model and extending the project’s
requirement for greater quality. Within the project team (Holmquist

<a href="#ref-Holmquist2007">2007</a>), an evaluator can play the role to channel
continuously the project evaluation criteria and bring a systematic
reflection which acts as <em>catalyst</em> for transformation.</p>
<p>Similarly to ambidexterity literature, the role creative leadership in
project management is identified as a way to manage generative processes
and its challenges for exploration. (Bech 
<a href="#ref-Bech2001">2001</a>)
stresses the proximity of project management and project leadership,
which can facilitate employee creativity, support the emergence of the
leader’s vision and organize collective creativity (Mainemelis, Kark,
and Epitropaki 
<a href="#ref-Mainemelis2015">2015</a>). Recent works also have put
the emphasis on the different leadership figures (Ezzat, Le Masson, and
Weil 
<a href="#ref-Ezzat2017a">2017</a>) including traditional ones such as the
visionary and the animator, but brings a novel perspective with the
<em>defixator</em> role. The leader brings the practice of defixation (Ezzat et
al. 
<a href="#ref-Ezzat2017">2017</a>) to creative team management with minimal
executive feedback so that team members can generate concepts avoiding
fixation effects.</p>
<p>Generative processes in project management as shown here tend to
constantly orchestrate value of novelty by circulating concepts and
meaning, or by comparison with some reference point. High constraints
and pressure in the iron triangle can also be a trigger for creativity
to reach such objectives or stretch goals (Maier and Branzei

<a href="#ref-Maier2014">2014</a>). But others have also put forward the violation
of project management rules (Mangematin et al.

<a href="#ref-Mangematin2011">2011</a>) as a means to support learning. Hacking can
be then encouraged to mitigate more efficiently risks associated with
delay and uncertainties as common project rules tend to increase risks
(Olin and Wickenberg 
<a href="#ref-Olin2001">2001</a>). Rule bending and
redefinition can be adjusted not only to generate better course of
action sustaining project’s (dynamic) performance and also exploration
guided by systematic rule breaking such as <em>skunkworks</em> (Bommer,
DeLaPorte, and Higgins 
<a href="#ref-Bommer2002">2002</a>).</p>
<p>Such generative processes are referred as non-routine work in the
framework of organizational routines (Obstfeld

<a href="#ref-Obstfeld2012">2012</a>). An echo of the <em>silent designers</em> introduced
by Angela Dumas and Henry Mintzberg. A creative project is defined in
such context as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>An emergent trajectory of interdependent action initiated and
orchestrated by multiple actors to introduce change into a social
context</em> <em>If organizational routines are viewed as trajectories of
interdependent action through which organizations generally get things
done, then creative projects are the means by which they get new
things started</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Placing the generation of routines into creative projects allows
D.Obstfeld to reconsider the interaction with adaptive model introduced
by James March through the <em>garbage can model</em>. He shows the extension
of the adaptive model where informal choices brought by creative
projects differing from the search of organizational routine. Whilst
keeping the idea to economize cognitive effort, one can rethink the
theorization of interdependent action including organizational routines
and generative processes. One can do so by stressing the emergence of
novel choices (not found by search) but through creative effort:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This expanded consideration of combinatorial elements underscores the
importance of knowledge articulation as a means for linking problems
to solutions, people to ideas (i.e., either problems or solutions),
and enlisting people to participate in unfolding action trajectories</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the figure below
(<a href="#fig:obstfeldroutines" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:obstfeldroutines">1</a>),
the impact of the interdependent action is represented and insists on
the nature of the direction of such non-routine work (stable,
incremental, radical and architectural):</p>

</figure>

<p>Research on the middle-ground present cases of how such routines emerge
and creative projects contribute to it. It reveals the different roles
endorsed by the project manager: sense-maker, game master, web-weaver,
and flow-balancer (Simon 
<a href="#ref-Simon2006">2006</a>). Later research
conducted in the game industry also demonstrated how a creative project,
in corporate entrepreneurship perspective, is managed to recombine
routines and rethink the new product development process across the firm
in addition to deliver a novel product radically changing the
traditional identity of the games developed (Cohendet and Simon

<a href="#ref-Cohendet2016">2016</a>).</p>
<p>The role of the leader is also emphasized in (Adler and Obstfeld

<a href="#ref-Adler2007">2007</a>) with a channelling effort on the project team by
bringing additional insight on the direction of <em>creative search</em>
supporting exploration. By revising Dewey’s philosophy, the importance
of impulse (affect) in addition to intelligence and habit drivers,
allows placing their respective impact on project, deliberation and
routine levels (see
Fig.<a href="#fig:adlerdewey" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:adlerdewey">2</a>)</p>

<p>The proposed analytical lens allows thinking what is to be managed and
the nature of the articulation of the generative processes in project
management and the interdependence with organizational routines for
instance. Despite having a different background, we cannot avoid
discussing the works of Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka, with the
use of ambiguity and metaphors (Dumas 
<a href="#ref-Dumas1994">1994</a>) to build
and drive project teams (also referred as knowledge teams); e.g. &ldquo;Tall
Boy&rdquo; for the Honda Civic and &ldquo;Rugby Player in a Dinner suit&rdquo; for the
Honda Accord (Nonaka 
<a href="#ref-Nonaka1991">1991</a>; Clark and Fujimoto

<a href="#ref-Clark1990">1990</a>). Whilst developing the knowledge management and
learning, later works of I.Nonaka have introduced the management concept
&ldquo;<em>ba</em>&rdquo; (literally meaning &ldquo;place&rdquo;, not necessarily physical):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What differentiates <span class="underline">ba</span> from ordinary
human interaction is the concept of knowledge creation. <span
class="underline">Ba</span> provides a platform for advancing
individual and/or collective knowledge. It is from such a platform
that a transcendental perspective integrates all information needed</em>
(Nonaka and Konno 
<a href="#ref-Nonaka1998">1998</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By developing an interactive approach to learning, socialization,
externalization, combination and internalization of processes (SECI
model), it helps describing what contributes to the dynamics of
knowledge management enact the common place of <em>ba</em>. In (Krogh, Ichijo,
and Nonaka 
<a href="#ref-VonKrogh2000">2000</a>), numerous qualitative studies
support this view enabling knowledge through creation of rich context,
building communities and supporting knowledge exchange. They insist on
numerous pitfalls such as a too strong focus on generating knowledge,
thus accentuating the articulation, interdependence and circulation of
knowledge rather than on quantity. It opposes to the view on the
generation of alternatives in J.March’s model discussed in the previous
chapter (March 
<a href="#ref-March2006">2006</a>).</p>
<p>Such perspective is further developed in the managing flow and
introducing also an ancient Greek concept of wisdom <em>phronesis</em>
insisting on the virtue of thinking of the context and judging value.
These processes sustain in their view creative dynamic capabilities by
opposition to adaptive ones at a meso-level (Nonaka, Hirose, and Takeda

<a href="#ref-Nonaka2016">2016</a>). Their demonstration and conceptualization goes
further in order to propose the image of a fractal organization as a
reflection of these knowledge dynamics supporting creative dynamic
capabilities (Nonaka et al. 
<a href="#ref-Nonaka2014">2014</a>), as multiple
&ldquo;edges&rdquo; are managed on multiple direction. Relying on the fractal idea,
raises the question of the pattern to be repeated to support. What is
the actual action logics driving this dynamic capability?</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>Finally, we have covered how the encapsulation of generative processes
in projects contribute to adaptive or interactive models at the project
level and with stakeholders. However, the organizational dimensions are
not addressed specially in the spirit of organizational ambidexterity,
despite still considering the separation of exploration and exploitation
but with some modulations (e.g. hacking).</p>
<p>Creative projects have a temporary nature (Bakker et al.
<a href="#ref-Bakker2013">2013</a>) imposing time frames over the project teams and
stakeholders determining tasks and team processes. After having
illustrated the nature of generative mechanisms in exploration and/or
exploration project management as a means to substantiate innovation
management, we must clarify the organizational ties supporting such
trajectories.</p>
<p>At this point of the literature review, it is important to note that
these ties were not as present with meta perspectives of the adaptive
model and the interactive model, since projects are used as experiments
for the whole firm, as an ambidextrous offshoot in an organization that
should be preserved for exploitation performance.</p>

<h2 id="project-based-organization-supporting-ambidexterity">Project-based organization supporting ambidexterity</h2>
<p>In the previous section, we extensively discussed the nature of
exploration project management and its engines such as creativity,
generative processes, non-routine work, rule bending, but also their
limitations and difficulties to loop back to an exploitation regime. The
key feature of the exploitation of exploration project requires a
continuous management of performance and valuation as the project
battles through the unknown.</p>
<p>In innovation management literature, along with the strong contingency
theoretical background that could be traced back to (Burns and Stalker

<a href="#ref-Burns1961">1961</a>), the notion of organic structure supporting
innovation in new product development led to the conceptualization of
the matrix organization where projects and product developments can pool
resources sustained by departments and units (Galbraith

<a href="#ref-Galbraith1971">1971</a>, 
<a href="#ref-Galbraith2010">2010</a>). It is the
preferred mode to <em>integrate cross-functional resources and knowledge to
cope with high uncertainty, complexity and change</em> (Davies, Manning, and
Söderlund 
<a href="#ref-Davies2018">2018</a>). These notions blended to the point
where projects became fully associated with the concept of organic and
flexible ways of organizing. Originally, in the detail of the Tom Burns
and Georges Stalker, the organic structure was defined based on one case
study and by contrast with the mechanistic cases (Hannan and Freeman

<a href="#ref-Hannan1989">1989</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It is instructive to note that Burns and Stalker found only one
instance of an organic structure in a situation in which this should
have been the appropriate form of organization. Their book is
essentially an analysis of why organization that ought (sic) to change
to organic systems fail to do so, even when there is high agreement
among their managers that they should move in that direction</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The advice given by T.Burns and G.Stalker should be treated carefully.
On the other side, the matrix organization has more cases to support the
interaction between the functional structure and projects. In (Galbraith

<a href="#ref-Galbraith1971">1971</a>), the transition from a functional form to
the other is detailed also with the transitioning with a task force to
cope with delays, and contingent factors are highlighted encouraging a
form or the other. The level of complexity and reconfigurability can be
increased to such height calling for careful management of careers,
opportunities and reconfigurable decision forums in addition to
satisfying changing client demands across the globe or just in identity
and customization (Galbraith 
<a href="#ref-Galbraith2010">2010</a>). We also point
out the fact that the change is conducted in a dissociate way to the
actual organizational life, i.e. as for organization design for
ambidexterity.</p>

<p>It is then crucial for exploration project and generative processes to
understand how efficient matrix organizations are to support these
projects but also sustain innovation and regenerative dynamic
capabilities of such organization. As we have shown, the leadership
figure was rather present, putting a lot of weight of its shoulders and
probably requiring training and management tools that still require to
be elucidated as revealed in the first chapter on paradox management.<br>
Here, we would like to discuss the organization design and studies
domains required to support the project management we are interested in.
The research community organized around journals such as the <em>Project
Management Journal</em> or <em>International Journal of Project Management</em>
have released numerous articles around the project-based management with
Rodney Turner’s lifework (Turner 
<a href="#ref-Turner2009">2009</a>), but also with
a special issue (Söderlund and Müller 
<a href="#ref-Soderlund2014a">2014</a>) in
PMJ, another in IJPM (Söderlund, Hobbs, and Ahola

<a href="#ref-Soderlund2014">2014</a>) and also two in Organizational Studies
(Sydow, Lindkvist, and Defillippi 
<a href="#ref-Sydow2004">2004</a>; Bakker et al.

<a href="#ref-Bakker2016">2016</a>). They raise several challenges around
theoretical model, methodologies including a lack of practice-based
research to enhance theoretical models.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    Firstly, we will discuss the organizational ties of exploration projects
compared to the host firm. The mirroring hypothesis between engineering
design rules and organization design will give us some ground to
understand where generative processes are rooted and the necessary
renewal for exploration projects. Secondly, we will naturally address
the topic of ad-hoc patterns, as exploration may lead to weighing the
anchor. Finally, we will deal with the concept of portfolio and program
management for exploration.
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="mirroring-hypothesis-and-renewal-of-resources-and-competencies">Mirroring hypothesis and renewal of resources and competencies</h3>
<p>In a matrix organization where projects are kicked off and requiring
resources in functional departments, exploration projects will request
competencies that may be off the charts. As a reference point, one can
imagine that the firm has settled its engineering for product
development and that it may even have developed modular engineering for
improved efficiency (MacCormack, Baldwin, and Rusnak

<a href="#ref-MacCormack2012">2012</a>). The mirroring hypothesis tested in (Colfer
and Baldwin 
<a href="#ref-Colfer2016">2016</a>) shows the congruence between
product architecture and organization. It also reveals the interest in
having a partial mirroring or the capacity of breaking the mirror for
strategic competitive advantage. In a normative perspective (Colfer and
Baldwin 
<a href="#ref-Colfer2016">2016</a>, 716) they advise that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The designers of technical systems are boundedly rational—they cannot
know or do everything. Thus, organizations are needed to carry out
complex design and production processes. For system architects and
organization designers, the design challenge is to create a technical
architecture and corresponding organization that together are capable
of carrying out complex tasks and solving problems that may come up
along the way</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The static view is of course enlightening, but mirroring dynamics are
not explicit. In the weakest form, they present the mirroring trap, i.e.
the failure of supporting ambidexterity, which can be countered by
partial mirroring where knowledge boundaries are broader than
operational task ones. It brings some slack to the alternatives and
interdependencies in product architecture, yet there is a risk of
‘early’ modularization causing failures because of lack of system
understanding. Due to the complexity and high rate of change, the system
knowledge will be necessarily incomplete, so they recommend (Colfer and
Baldwin 
<a href="#ref-Colfer2016">2016</a>, 724):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In such cases, organizational processes that deviate from strict
mirroring are likely to be beneficial in terms of technical
performance, competitive advantage, and the accumulation of valuable
knowledge and capabilities. A “partial mirroring” strategy can be an
effective way to explore and understand latent interdependencies that
are not apparent under the current technical architecture.
Furthermore, if the stakes are sufficiently high, firms may go
further, overturning the current architecture for their own strategic
advantage. Strategic mirror-breaking, if successful, can bring about
wholesale changes to industry structure.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exploration projects will tend to play in partial mirroring organization
where latent interdependencies may be challenged. It would imply
technical and engineering issues, at a modular or even call for
architectural innovation (Henderson and Clark

<a href="#ref-Henderson1990">1990</a>). The temporary organization supporting the
project may be then in conflict with the established mirroring
organizing.</p>
<p>In a very recent detailed literature review, Maxim Miterev, Rodney
Turner and colleagues bring the link with the organization design and
project-based organization. For instance, in (Miterev, Engwall, and
Jerbrant 
<a href="#ref-Miterev2017">2017</a>) they warn us (through practice-based
research) on threats of isomorphism mechanisms (mimicry, coercion and
normative) against temporary-organization supporting one-off projects
dealing with high uncertainty (see below
Fig.<a href="#fig:miterevisomorph" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:miterevisomorph">4</a>).</p>

    Isomorphic pressures on project-based organization (Miterev, Engwall, and Jerbrant <a href="#ref-Miterev2017">2017</a>)
  </figcaption>


</figure>

<p>The goal rationality of such organization is then questioned specially
in a context of inter-relatedness of temporal organization with a
host/established functional organization in addition to institutional
fields. They advocate that isomorphic pressures may vary depending on
industrial sectors but that <em>skunkworks</em> projects may be required to
escape such pressures of project-based organization. Institutional
entrepreneurship is seen as an another perspective to further understand
how novel practices countering pressures can be institutionalized in
firms.</p>
<p>Following the idea of extreme forces of reconfigurability (Galbraith

<a href="#ref-Galbraith2010">2010</a>), the project-based organization identified
as a proper organization form calls for a renewal of organization design
as discussed in (Miterev, Turner, and Mancini

<a href="#ref-Miterev2017b">2017</a>). It resurfaces the contingency of numerous
managerial phenomena and the links with wider unit of analysis in
organization studies and design. In a rationally bounded perspective,
(Simon 
<a href="#ref-Simon1967">1967</a>) gave his definition of organization
design with the adaptive model associated to decision-making and
information processing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[Organizational design] is to investigate the information flows
that are essential for accomplishing the organization’s objectives,
then examine what these information patterns imply for organization
structure</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, the issue is that introducing adaptive, interactive, and
generative processes that may be encapsulated or not, should be
translated into design rules given a rational goal (Burton and Obel

<a href="#ref-Burton2018">2018</a>). The matrix form compared to the unitary one
was a way to deal with adaptation. It could lead, depending on places
and flow, to support exploration-related interactions. Can
organizational rules be generative? Are there design rules unlocking
interdependencies? Can the temporary organization support organizational
generativity?<br>
In (Van de Ven, Ganco, and Hinings 
<a href="#ref-VandeVen2013">2013</a>, 396), the
authors trace the evolution of organization design evolving from
&ldquo;<em>contingency to configuration, to complementarity, and to complexity
and creative theories of organizing</em>&quot;. The question of organizational
fit is then treated with whole new perspective: <em>generative fit</em> (Avital
and Te’eni 
<a href="#ref-Avital2009">2009</a>). The suggested rules for generative
designs should be evocative, open-ended and adaptive. It is worth
mentioning that their notion of adaptation embeds the concept of
re-invention which goes beyond the notion we have chosen stemming from
J.March’s view<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Quoting (Barry 
<a href="#ref-Barry2011">2011</a>, 9), Andrew
Van de Ven, in the spirit of managing as design (Boland and Collopy

<a href="#ref-Boland2004">2004</a>) and thinking of organizations as design (Romme

<a href="#ref-Romme2003">2003</a>), proposes to follow up the emergent role of
professional designers, or architects as they blend several disciplines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>perhaps a more unified organization design school will emerge, where
“delight, deliver, and deepen” all come together using bits and pieces
from both orientations. To be successful thought, this new OD
[organization design] will require a lot more than asking executives
to brainstorm, prototype, and otherwise “get creative”. Coming up with
effective organization designs that deliver, delight, and deepen will
require training along the lines that designers get years of learning
how to reframe organizational problems into evocative questions,
finding inspirational networks alongside solutional ones, creative and
aesthetically sophisticated experimentation, and working with multiple
mediums and representational forms. It will also require systematic
testing over time, to see where and how these innovative designs work,
and don’t work. Clearly OD is heading towards a new chapter, perhaps
its most interesting and inventive one yet.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite being an open invitation for future research, the hints given to
support such generative design rules for the organization remains quite
unclear and again bring back contingency theories to front seat with
numerous interactions (Van de Ven, Ganco, and Hinings

<a href="#ref-VandeVen2013">2013</a>). Such contextuality is confirmed in (Turner,
Maylor, and Swart 
<a href="#ref-Turner2015">2015</a>) bringing an analysis of
project management with organization ambidexterity literature stressing
the dynamics between human, social and organizational capital. Or even
with (Winch 
<a href="#ref-Winch2014">2014</a>) proposing three domains of project
organizing: project-based firms, projects/programs, and
owners/operators. Their interactions stress the interfaces of
governance, resources and commercial domains.</p>
<p>When considering exploration project management, or at least, management
contributions integrating complexity and contingency theory (Shenhar and
Dvir 
<a href="#ref-Shenhar2007">2007</a>), it is worth pointing out the managerial
implications are very short on what should be done regarding the
structural and social dimension of project-based management. At best,
(Asquin, Garel, and Picq 
<a href="#ref-Asquin2007">2007</a>) identifies the risk of
loosing knowledge and competencies in project-based organization because
of lack of expertise and human resources to cope with reconfigurability.
And in (Aggeri and Segrestin 
<a href="#ref-Aggeri2007">2007</a>), project
management methods were studied for their negative effects on collective
learning, and the critical implication for innovation department.</p>
<p>Finally, in one of the chapters of the Cambridge Handbook of
Organizational Project Management, (Pollack 
<a href="#ref-Pollack2017">2017</a>)
proposes to reconsider change management and project management given a
recent volume of the Project Management Institute entitled ‘Managing
Change in Organizations: A Practice Guide’. He underlines the risks of
not fully integrating change in management of portfolio, programs and
projects, may lead to change being a simple option. However the
challenge, is on the different perception of action in both fields.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    Change management puts emphasis on communicating change, instead on the
definition and control of the change project delivery. What is the
contribution to exploration project to organizational ambidexterity?
Such cleavage on the encapsulation of exploration with respect to
established organization raises then several questions on the
by-products of the related generative processes on the organization
structure.
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="risk-of-ad-hoc-epicormic-shoot-and-no-generative-learning">Risk of ad-hoc: epicormic shoot and no generative learning</h3>
<p>The previous paragraphs show the tendency of project management to
require a temporary organization. Thus, it pushes further the notion of
matrix organization and potential decentralization as it requires more
flexibility, reconfigurability, scalability. It is a means to deal with
higher levels of uncertainty and potentially integrating the unknown.</p>
<p>In that perspective (Hornstein 
<a href="#ref-Hornstein2015">2015</a>) makes a call
to merge organizational change and project management, as project should
be seen as proper organizational change initiative in order to integrate
also technical, social and behavioural issues. Otherwise, he recognizes
that an increasing number of project management enquiries are
integrating change elements focusing mainly on the process rather than
on the contingent dimensions. It has, then, a very different assumption
on organization design compared to organizational ambidexterity.<br>
(O’Reilly and Tushman 
<a href="#ref-OReilly2007">2007</a>) proposed to resolve the
spin-off strategy of the innovator’s dilemma by adopting an
organizational design supporting structural ambidexterity given high
strategic importance and operational leverage (see
Fig.<a href="#fig:figoreilly2007" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:figoreilly2007">5</a>).
Such design allows then balancing exploration and exploitation,
transferring, organizing learning given the crucial role of top
management’s leadership overseeing such global picture.</p>

</figure>

<p>By comparison with (Christensen 
<a href="#ref-Christensen1997">1997</a>), where the
focus is on organization’s value and organization’s processes,
considering the operational leverage allows thinking of the host
organization supporting the team targeting the radical or disruptive
innovation. It creates the tension to find a <em>generative fit</em> between
the project’s exploration and exploitation needs and constraints
(e.g. high entry barrier, technical complexity and certification). Of
course, it is not an end per se: (Engwall and Svensson

<a href="#ref-Engwall2004a">2004</a>) calls for <em>cheetah teams</em> as an extreme
version of agile and reconfigurable projects that could be launched to
cope with urgent and unanticipated issues. This offshoot of a project
creates anyway some sort of paradox regarding the embedded nature of
projects (Sydow, Lindkvist, and Defillippi 
<a href="#ref-Sydow2004">2004</a>).</p>
<p>The question could become then how centralized should the encapsulation
of exploration and adaptation be. As studied in (Siggelkow and Levinthal

<a href="#ref-Siggelkow2003">2003</a>) (de/)centralization is nor right or wrong
but rather they advocate a temporary decentralization to support
exploration and adaptation. They propose to play around
interdependencies of firm activities addressed by such temporary
structures to increase the performance of exploration and exploitation.
When considering the acquisitions of technologies as an exploration
enabler, (Puranam, Singh, and Zollo 
<a href="#ref-Puranam2006">2006</a>) points out
the criticality of synchronization of the organizational shift with the
technological maturity. The notion of interdependence becomes key again
as an exploration project may disrupt <em>epistemic interdependencies</em>
(Puranam, Raveendran, and Knudsen 
<a href="#ref-Puranam2012a">2012</a>).</p>
<p>However, the literature tends to stress mainly the importance of
governance and resources to steer these projects (Winch

<a href="#ref-Winch2014">2014</a>; Turner and Müller 
<a href="#ref-Turner2017a">2017</a>).
Even when managers don’t fully understand projects (Loch, Mähring, and
Sommer 
<a href="#ref-Loch2017">2017</a>), they are critical to discuss underlying
models and overcome crises to generate new alternatives. Contingency
perspectives will also stress the determinism of project trajectories
given history and context (Engwall 
<a href="#ref-Engwall2003">2003</a>). So, to
avoid thinking that projects are simple tools, the unit of analysis
should be elevated to the thinking of temporary-organization as
discussed in the previous paragraphs (Packendorff

<a href="#ref-Packendorff1995">1995</a>). It could avoid the shortcomings of the
‘one-off’ project.</p>
<p>Another perspective, inspired by design, will tend to blend design
reasoning and theories to re-thinking organizations (Romme

<a href="#ref-Romme2003">2003</a>). Embedding generative processes across the
organization as general mindset and practice could enact
<em>design-oriented organization</em> (Hatchuel, Weil, and Le Masson

<a href="#ref-Hatchuel2006">2006</a>). The design-oriented organization would aim
at systematically creating positively deviant projects and programs that
rely on (generative) dynamic capabilities of the firm. It gives a fresh
look on intrapreneurship and corporate entrepreneurship, as generative
design rules across the firm would support such projects. It echoes the
works of Phanish Puranam quoted earlier, and still require further case
studies and detail to fully embody such models.</p>
<p>Thinking of generative processes across the firm, (Adler

<a href="#ref-Adler1995">1995</a>) reveals the dynamics of coordination tasks and
mechanisms during a product development’s life cycle (project framing,
design &amp; development and manufacturing). The interdependencies revealed
by differences in the degree of novelty and degree of fit will call for
different coordination mechanisms (standards, schedules, mutual
adjustment and teams):</p>

<p>Considering project for exploration and exploitation underscores its
strategic dimension for the firm as discussed in (Adler and Obstfeld

<a href="#ref-Adler2007">2007</a>), and pictured below:</p>

  </figcaption>


</figure>

<p>Consequently, the risk of ad-hoc (temporary) organization supporting an
exploration project could easily become real as interdependencies slip
away. Poor stakeholder management where legitimacy building is key
(Hooge and Dalmasso 
<a href="#ref-Hooge2015">2015</a>; Eskerod

<a href="#ref-Eskerod2017">2017</a>) could accentuate the phenomenon. Governance,
for inter-organizational and multi-level perspectives, is necessary
(Sydow and Braun 
<a href="#ref-Sydow2018">2018</a>) to address the traditionally
implicit technical/social/organizational interdependent facets in
temporary organization.</p>
<p>Projects calling for inter-organizational/departmental support show the
crucial role of <em>concurrent platform innovation process</em> supporting the
temporary-organization of radical exploration project: e.g. electric car
developed in a traditional combustion car company (Von Pechmann et al.

<a href="#ref-VonPechmann2015">2015</a>). However, as the industrial context may be
subject to a high rate of change, a full projectification of the firm
(Beaume, Maniak, and Midler 
<a href="#ref-Beaume2009">2009</a>), the (feedback)
learning with functional department is rarely, if not never, addressed
with the respect to legacy engineering or other mirrored features of the
organizational structure.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>An exploration project in a more or less developed project-based
organization can then lead to a spin-off. The fact that innovation
managed and encapsulated in exploration projects raises significant
questions for organizational coherence and design for ambidexterity. Be
it permanently ad-hoc or temporary organization driven by architectural
innovation (Henderson and Clark <a href="#ref-Henderson1990">1990</a>), the image
of the epicormic shoot in plant biology is quite seducing. Wouldn’t it
call for the co-existence of exploration feeding from exploitation?</p>
<p>It is (perhaps) a positively deviant part of a tree that grows in a
place where it is not really supposed to be (e.g. tiny branch on the
lower tree trunk, instead of on the ground or on a fully developed
branch). It feeds from established resources, but perhaps it makes some
sense at higher unit of analysis as discussed for project-based
organization.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, it may be too reductive to consider projects not as
ephemeral but rather by trying to making them more permanent
(Müller-Seitz and Sydow <a href="#ref-Mueller2011">2011</a>). Such non-termination
can also be sustained by learning mechanisms in-between projects in time
(Hartmann and Dorée <a href="#ref-Hartmann2015">2015</a>) but also in multi-project
perspective as we discuss in the following paragraphs. This added
time-scale and synergy, calls for some kind of organizational metabolism
if we carry on with the biological analogy. Metabolism would refer to
what comes out or is at the heard of interactions between processes
(projects) and structures (organization designs).</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="portfolio-and-program-management-for-exploration">Portfolio and program management for exploration</h3>
<p>Whilst taking the assumption we are in a project-based economy and
project-based organization, where the matrix form is further developed
with high levels of reconfigurability (Galbraith

<a href="#ref-Galbraith2010">2010</a>), the notion of portfolio and program
management allows revisiting the risk of the ad-hoc, the spin-off, and
the epicormic shoot with respect to the host organizational form. For
instance, by extending (Hobday 
<a href="#ref-Hobday2000">2000</a>), (Gemünden,
Lehner, and Kock 
<a href="#ref-Gemunden2018">2018</a>) defines a project-based
organization insisting on the different levels of management that should
be aligned and integrated so that it can be declined around structure,
value and people management (see

<p>This ecology of projects makes then a lot of sense and may sustain
innovation as described in (Von Pechmann et al.

<a href="#ref-VonPechmann2015">2015</a>). It considers a projectified firm
(Renault), where radical projects will be systematically launched
through the interactions of strategy, programs and projects organized in
a temporary manner and fully serviced by functional departments. The
network of projects can also be seen as fishing net for value management
(Laursen 
<a href="#ref-Laursen2018">2018</a>) which can be organized with a
multi-lineage approach of product development (R. Maniak and Midler

<a href="#ref-Maniak2014b">2014</a>).</p>
<p>The strategic management will tend to balance the control and
open/emergent approach of this multi-project management (Kopmann, Kock,
and Killen 
<a href="#ref-Kopmann2017">2017</a>), and tend to encourage the
establishment of a dedicated function, potentially requiring an
institutionalization of innovation (O’Connor 
<a href="#ref-OConnor2016">2016</a>).
Robert Burgelman in (Burgelman 
<a href="#ref-Burgelman1983a">1983</a>) had
questioned whether &ldquo;structure follows strategy&rdquo; or &ldquo;strategy follows
structure&rdquo;. He proposed new analytical lens insisting on the
interactions between strategic behaviour, corporate context and concept
of strategy to blur the lines between a purely induced strategy by top
management and the emergence of autonomous strategic activities. This
projectified view of the firm with exploration and exploitation taking
place on multiple levels and directions is quite in line with
R.Burgelman’s perspective. And it departs from the models of
ambidexterity, except for the contextual which blunt the edges of the
non-mutual conditioning between exploration and exploitation.</p>
<p>In this ecology of projects, introducing the concept of trajectory
(Aubry and Lavoie-Tremblay 
<a href="#ref-Aubry2018">2018</a>) - which can also be
found in the works of Rémi Maniak and Christophe Midler on Renault -
allows studying the interaction between projects and (project-based)
organization design over time. With an interactionist approach,
sensemaking and reflexivity was accounted before decisions associated
with organization design. Monique Aubry suggests that further
understanding should be developed around the sensemaking supporting
learning between projects and project managers as it will feed the
governance and leadership embodying the strategic management.</p>
<p>The notion of <em>program</em> becomes quite stimulating to support this kind
of system thinking. It is defined by the International Project
Management Association and the Project Management Institute as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>a set of related projects and required organizational changes to
reach a strategic goal and to achieve the defined business benefits</em>
(IPMA) <em>program as a group of related projects, subprograms, and
program activities that must be managed in a coordinated way in order
to achieve benefits that may not be obtained if they are managed
individually</em> (PMI)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compared to the portfolio and multi-project management, programs
emphasize the link between the projects whilst giving also more weight
to strategy, stakeholder management and complexity (Patanakul and Pinto

<a href="#ref-Patanakul2017">2017</a>). The strategy/execution of the program
involves then political work, flexibility and managing interdependencies
targeted and revealed by the criticality of uncertain technologies
developed along the way and to be integrated. The program also develops
a certain bureaucracy to administrate the portfolio with a Program
Management Office.</p>
<p>Risk management and change control are among their main tasks. Learning
mechanisms can also be centralized through lessons learnt through
project delivery. When discussing, for instance, corporate venture
capital investments (Keil, Zahra, and Maula 
<a href="#ref-Keil2016">2016</a>), they
put forward factors influencing learning benefits for exploration and
exploitation. Entrepreneurial opportunities of the incumbents should be
articulated with skills and ideas showcased by start-ups, at it gives
way to previous generated opportunities or even generate further
opportunities for entrepreneurship. The portfolio level gives more
context and contrast to pool opportunities. It constitutes most of the
program governance contributing to exploration and exploitation
organizational learning as transactions are made with start-ups.</p>
<p>The governance of portfolio of projects, seen as a program, and with
project-based organization gives more weight to a change project (Gareis

<a href="#ref-Gareis2010">2010</a>). The change management could then be fully
embedded in the project, instead of seeing it as a different management.
However, the tendency is to operate a dichotomy making change a project
and a technical project (e.g. product development), instead of embedding
change within the project. In a literature review on program management
(Martinsuo and Hoverfält 
<a href="#ref-Martinsuo2018">2018</a>), Miia Martinsuo
develops propositions for future research on change program management
towards organizational capability as it has been moving from the
traditional plan &amp; control approach as it integrates value management,
synergies across programs, stakeholder management in addition to a means
to succeed in the organization’s environment.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>Finally, we have seen that unit of analysis of the portfolio of
projects, and more specifically, the notion of program management gives
more weight to the strategic management of the underlying projects. This
concern with respect to the project-based organization would then
emphasize the triad: structure, the value and people management.</p>
<p>What it also stressed is that there is a governance of such pool of
activities that is slightly shifted compared to the functional structure
as it answers directly to the environment through clients, instead of
&ldquo;only&rdquo; dealing with standards, regulations and sustaining a body of
knowledge. It gives then more weight to the project-based organization
and generative fit to be managed as exploration projects develop their
yet-to-be known trajectories.</p>
<p>Consequently, as ambidexterity could be managed at the program level to
potentially metabolize projects with organizations, we must now precise
the role of environment perception. Understanding the environment will
allow anticipating adaptation and thus adjust the program for change. To
metabolize could then refer to the dynamics of interactions between
projects, and how it contribute to organizational change.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<hr>
<h2 id="change-project-and-the-environment">Change project and the environment</h2>
<p>In the previous section, we have discussed the organizational dimension
of project management and its implications for exploration projects
supporting generative processes as a means for innovation management. We
have shown that the literature in the field has come to a point where
project-based organization, seen as temporary organization, and an
extension of matrix organization, are state-of-art to support innovation
management. However, the literature reveals numerous limitations and has
made repeated calls to further merge the teachings of organization
studies and design to better understand the value management, human
resources management as well as interdependencies in between departments
and (temporary) organizations. We have also pointed that detailed work
from engineering and design management were able to address these
<em>epistemic interdependencies</em> and introduce notions such as <em>generative
fit</em> to support congruence in innovation management. These elements
could play a role in organization metabolism for ambidexterity.</p>
<p>The encapsulated nature of the projects allows more flexibility and
potential reconfigurability that can be sustained through appropriate
governance, in a more efficient way than traditional centralized and
functional organizations. Of course, such concern is rather contingent
to the maturity of technology, the market rate of change, task
complexity and environment turbulence.</p>
<p>The notion of environment is perhaps easier to look at, seen from the
project perspective, as it concentrates collective action in a project
team. The adaptive model takes into account the environment by defining
what is external to the adaptive system. And the notion of environment
becomes more blurry with interactionism as the notions of boundaries in
a network may be hard to delimitate unless one is able to cluster. Where
does the firm’s environment start? How is it observed and managed?</p>
<p>This section will consider how the project-based management regards the
environment, with also a concern for the way in which the environment is
discussed in the adaptive and interactionist models. We have made the
assumption of the projectification of firms. And so far, we have seen it
can relate to ambidexterity models discussed in the previous chapter
depending on the level of analysis and viewpoint (structure, process,
social and system). To discuss these topics, we propose to draw from
system theory and developments by Maturana and Varela (see for instance
the analysis of images of organization in (Morgan

<a href="#ref-Morgan2006">2006</a>)). They introduce the concept of <em>autopoiesis</em>
which interprets differently the frontier between system and environment
applied to biology. They introduce the idea that a system interacts with
the environment by thinking of it as a reflection and part of its own
organization<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. The principles of autopoiesis (self-generation) are
based on autonomy, circularity and self-reference. The cognition of the
&ldquo;environment&rdquo; is constituted of patterns of variations and reference
points reflecting its own organization mode, so that the environment is
organized as an extension of itself.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    Firstly, we will start by looking at the way in which the environment is
responded to. Secondly, as projects and organizations will tend to
organize their extension in the environment, we will look at the open
innovation literature and its implications for project management. At
last, we will consider how the firm can reorganize or regenerate itself
to constantly address these patterns of variations engaged between the
system and its &ldquo;environment&rdquo;.
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="responding-exploring-and-exploiting-to-the-environment">Responding, exploring, and exploiting to the environment</h3>
<p>The teachings from previous experiences can encourage some kind of
responses to prepare in some way to the environment dynamics. Among the
variety of pre-emptive strategies (Macmillan

<a href="#ref-Macmillan1983">1983</a>), timing to offer to the market a new concept
(product, service, feature, architecture etc.) through careful project
management is crucial, as it comes with its set of advantages and
disadvantages (Lieberman and Montgomery 
<a href="#ref-Lieberman1988">1988</a>,

<a href="#ref-Lieberman1998">1998</a>). As described by Lieberman, several firm’s
resources will be of different nature depending on the strategy (pioneer
or follower) and the decision to enter at a certain rank the new market.
The created value space will be dependent on luck and dynamic
capabilities (Teece, Pisano, and Shuen 
<a href="#ref-Teece1997">1997</a>).</p>
<p>It is dependent on numerous control variables, so given the tone of our
literature review, we propose the case where the market or operational
ecosystem’s dynamics are pretty stable with long development lead times.
There are no visible threats of new entrants due to high entry barriers
and strong dominant design (Abernathy and Utterback

<a href="#ref-Abernathy1978">1978</a>). In those markets, the long term strategy is
to be able to be ready when the new dominant design comes out (Macmillan

<a href="#ref-Macmillan1983">1983</a>; Christensen 
<a href="#ref-Christensen1997">1997</a>).
It becomes then complex to support the necessity to invest into
resources and dynamic capabilities for a risky and uncertain course of
action.</p>
<p>Having slack resources appear crucial to innovate, yet the relationship
between these two would be curvilinear (Herold, Jayaraman, and
Narayanaswamy 
<a href="#ref-Herold2006">2006</a>; Nohria and Gulati

<a href="#ref-Nohria1996">1996</a>). The inverted U-shape relationship between
slack and innovation pushes the optimization game on extremely complex
grounds as it is also dependent on multiple control variables (Nohria
and Gulati 
<a href="#ref-Nohria1997">1997</a>). It is also stressed that the nature
of slack resources (absorption and rarity) will have a different effect
on product exploration/exploitation given the (non-)existence of
ecosystem’s threats (Voss, Sirdeshmukh, and Voss 
<a href="#ref-Voss2008">2008</a>).</p>
<p>By referring to prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky

<a href="#ref-Kahneman1979a">1979</a>), they build upon the concept of framing and
anchoring to explain the moderating effects of the environment
perception on the nature of available resources<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Their research was
further developed to show different patterns of exploration/exploitation
relative to the environment (Voss and Voss 
<a href="#ref-Voss2013">2013</a>). They
propose that the balancing of the two modes could be conducted along the
dimensions of the product and the market. They emphasize the known
paradoxical myopic behaviour of large established firms having the
resources but not implementing ambidexterity for product development,
and they also confirm the need for sustained market ambidexterity for
long-term growth. The latter can also be directly linked to the failure
of stage-gate models in project management as described in (Sethi and
Iqbal 
<a href="#ref-Sethi2008">2008</a>) which tend to make beforehand strong and
stable hypothesis on the environment. It questions again the actual
practice of product ambidexterity, and ways of sustaining
exploration/exploitation through project management, since the
ambidextrous organization design may not be observed in the same way.</p>
<p>The necessity to change the organization comes from the cognition of a
change in circumstances. One could also develop the need to adapt
further by exploring yet to be known alternatives and generating new
knowledge. Relying on real options theory for instance, (Fredberg

<a href="#ref-Fredberg2007">2007</a>) encourages to think of the importance of the
generation of options along the product development process. Bringing
design theory closer to real options allows then coping with high
uncertainty and turbulence of the environment, but also stresses how the
new choices and their value should be positioned in the real options
tree. This pattern recalls the notion of pre-emptive strategies
(Macmillan 
<a href="#ref-Macmillan1983">1983</a>, 17) with the idea that one should
shape one’s luck:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Good generals make their luck by shaping the odds in their favor and
by being able to spot and rapidly capitalize on every emergent
opportunity created by the mistakes of their opponents, or by the good
fortune they have helped to shape&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before jumping to tricking the new environment’s odds, the adaptive
model can still bring some valuable subtleties. By developing the
canonical bandit (Posen and Levinthal 
<a href="#ref-Posen2012">2012</a>) -
extending James March’s model - Hart Posen and Daniel Levinthal develop
the idea that environment change decreases the rewards of exploratory
efforts at accumulating knowledge (inverted U-shape between the optimal
degree of adaptiveness of the search strategy and turbulence frequency).</p>
<p>So organizing change may induce a renewed focus on exploiting old
knowledge, beliefs and opportunities. For instance in (Jansen, Van Den
Bosch, and Volberda 
<a href="#ref-Jansen2006">2006</a>), ambidexterity is studied
in relationship with organizational antecedents such as centralization,
formalization and connectedness. Such search strategies supporting
organizational adaptation will reflect the conception of environment’s
dynamism and competitiveness, i.e. a set of actions conditioned by
knowledge mapping of the (believed-)world (Posen and Levinthal

<a href="#ref-Posen2012">2012</a>, 598). However, the results of Justin Jansen and
colleagues, may be considered insufficient as the organizational choices
such as decentralization and environment dynamism will encourage
exploration. Nevertheless, the example of the General Motor’s car in
(Posen and Levinthal 
<a href="#ref-Posen2012">2012</a>) shows the greater
exploration was not beneficial as they ended up with a poor
new-environmental fit because the turbulence devalued existing knowledge
and also devalued the chances of returns associated to generating new
knowledge. They consequently insist on the <em>finesse</em> of such nuances of
exploration/exploitation and the unknown (Posen and Levinthal

<a href="#ref-Posen2012">2012</a>, 599):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The challenge for organizations is the ex-ante assessment of the
magnitudes of these two competing forces.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The modes of exploration and exploitation do reveal that the non-mutual
conditioning of both could be revisited. At least, exploration project
management does bring a new flavour to adaptation and engagement with
environment. Consequently, the role of strategic leadership for
exploration and exploitation can then naturally be linked to the
influence of environmental dynamism (Jansen, Vera, and Crossan

<a href="#ref-Jansen2009">2009</a>). Still in the line of thought of ambidextrous
models, it places the emphasis on leadership and top-management role to
cope with such organizational challenges. But isn’t there an approach in
between to cope with organizational metabolism?</p>
<p>These takeaways again encourage to promote the simultaneous thinking and
implementation of managements of project and organizational change as
discussed in previous paragraphs (Pollack 
<a href="#ref-Pollack2017">2017</a>;
Hornstein 
<a href="#ref-Hornstein2015">2015</a>).</p>
<p>Relying on the product development literature and project management, we
find how different adaptive arrangements can be made at the product
design level. (Sanchez and Mahoney 
<a href="#ref-Sanchez1996">1996</a>) develop the
knowledge management supported by modular product architecture reflected
in organization design. It reduces the cost and difficulties of adaptive
coordination. The environment dynamism and turbulence can then easily be
coped with as long as the architecture remains stable: the firm will
remain flexible with the modules’ boundaries. Leaving a loose structure
(Nogueira and Raz 
<a href="#ref-Nogueira2006">2006</a>) will then prove beneficial
against turbulent environment specially if teams can (re-)organize the
product design. Such perspective is even further developed with the idea
of fractal organizations (Nonaka et al. 
<a href="#ref-Nonaka2014">2014</a>) by
considering multiple interfaces at the project level (Nonaka, Hirose,
and Takeda 
<a href="#ref-Nonaka2016">2016</a>). These meso-foundations allow
reconnecting with the locus where knowledge is generated and managed,
and the creative side of dynamic capabilities taking place at the
team-level and organized my middle management.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, whilst insisting on interdependencies and drawing
from practices of product design and engineering, system engineering can
considerably provide an enhanced perspective on the governance of
project-based organization in complex environments. (Locatelli, Mancini,
and Romano 
<a href="#ref-Locatelli2014">2014</a>) proposed to shift to a
<em>system-based</em>, and thus a <em>system governance</em>, with for instance
naturally embedding the system thinking and supporting the re-use of
system elements. The role of project management offices in governing
performance appears then crucial to prepare environment responses. For
instance, a temporary entity (&ldquo;transition support office&rdquo;) can be
designed to conduct change with permanent entities by addressing
paradoxes and challenges in order to support a learning process in the
project-based organization (Aubry, Richer, and Lavoie-Tremblay

<a href="#ref-Aubry2014">2014</a>). Adapting to the change of circumstances can
then be addressed by directly managing the adaptation of project rules
(project management office) and product/system design.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>These logics of engagement with the environment can be pushed even
further by considering the move to work closely with the origins of some
of these turbulences in the supplier-client relationship by moving from
a settled project management (co-development) to a more exploratory
context (co-innovation) (Maniak et al. <a href="#ref-Maniak2008">2008</a>). It
avoids the caveats of traditional logics of reacting to change.</p>
<p>In (Colfer and Baldwin <a href="#ref-Colfer2016">2016</a>) - when discussing the
mirroring hypothesis - echoes of the fractal organizations of I.Nonaka
can be found with a call for collaboration across firm boundaries as a
means, to deal with <em>epistemic interdependencies</em> (Puranam
<a href="#ref-Puranam2012">2012</a>). The simultaneity of project management
(through product development) and organizational change (in the form of
change project) is then reinforced. It encourages opening the boundaries
of innovation in a project-based organization, or even in a adaptive
model perspective. The generation of new alternatives, new knowledge by
interacting with the environment can then be fully embedded in the
project in order to value the exploitative or exploration dimensions.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="freeing-exploring-and-exploiting-innovation">Freeing, exploring and exploiting innovation</h3>
<p>Coming back to (Kline and Rosenberg 
<a href="#ref-Kline1986">1986</a>) showcasing a
linear model of innovation, it becomes challenging to withstand it
against open innovation. Indeed, its complex nature will bring several
changes to the market, the social context and product system.
Reinforcing the interdependencies of the technology and economic realms,
the authors naturally call to open the innovation black box (economist
view) and the process of technologist. They have a tendency to forget
the market environment and its dynamics. The open innovation then
encourages to find the origin of such dynamics and place the product
development effort over such domain.</p>
<p>The role of lead-users (Hippel 
<a href="#ref-VonHippel1986">1986</a>,

<a href="#ref-VonHippel2005">2005</a>) can be rallied support ideation and
valuation of new concepts. Bringing user input, supplier relationship
but also manufacturers (Franke 
<a href="#ref-Franke2014">2014</a>; Hippel

<a href="#ref-VonHippel2007">2007</a>) can then support innovation management for
the firm up to an extreme point where innovation is fully taken care of
by users (Hippel 
<a href="#ref-VonHippel2016a">2016</a>). Freeing innovation tends
to fully open economists’ black box, it severely challenges transaction
costs and incomplete contracts perspective such as (Aghion and Tirole

<a href="#ref-Aghion1994a">1994</a>) where innovation is simply described through
patents and funding. See figure below:</p>

    The free innovation paradigm and the producer innovation paradigm (von Hippel <a href="#ref-VonHippel2016a">2016</a>)
  </figcaption>


</figure>

<p>Maintaining the interactions between the two paradigms can also be
organized as a means to manage the environment by collaboratively making
sense along the design with users themselves. It can create new
requirements and eventually new products (Magnusson, Matthing, and
Kristensson 
<a href="#ref-Magnusson2003">2003</a>; Kristensson, Magnusson, and
Matthing 
<a href="#ref-Kristensson2002">2002</a>; Hewing and Hölzle

<a href="#ref-Hewing2014">2014</a>). In a similar way, the design-driven
perspective of innovation management, (Verganti and Dell’Era

<a href="#ref-Verganti2014">2014</a>) calls to identify and work with
<em>interpreters</em> that could be better identified through a wider system
thinking, better understanding of the whole value chain and environment
awareness. We could then think of exploiting such potential innovation
sources for the organization.</p>
<p>The new loci of innovation (Lakhani, Lifshitz-Assaf, and Tushman

<a href="#ref-Lakhani2013">2013</a>) create tensions to contour the organizational
boundaries, and they propose instead to approach this difficulty of
opening/closing boundaries by addressing the decomposition of tasks and
the knowledge distribution supporting problem-solving. It stresses again
the role of leadership to perform the associated strategic
decomposition, as a means to decide of organization designs. The
(strategic) decision-making comes back to the front seat or at least
shifting the attention to collaborative problem framing (and
decomposition) with some added uncertainty. Even with common generative
practices, the structure and formulation of complex problems are crucial
(Kavadias and Sommer 
<a href="#ref-Kavadias2009">2009</a>), implying the importance
of mediators creative leadership or adequate design management tools to
regulate group dynamics (Ezzat, Le Masson, and Weil

<a href="#ref-Ezzat2017a">2017</a>; Ezzat et al. 
<a href="#ref-Ezzat2017">2017</a>). The
collaboration means imply careful co-design practices (Berger et al.

<a href="#ref-Berger2005">2005</a>) and partnering.</p>
<p>Indeed, it has also been clarified how the role of co-creation enhances
exploration/exploitation learning in project-based organization
(Eriksson, Leiringer, and Szentes 
<a href="#ref-Eriksson2017">2017</a>). Moving to
a &ldquo;private-collective&rdquo; model of innovation as in the case of open-source
software domain (Hippel and Krogh 
<a href="#ref-VonHippel2003">2003</a>) allows
shifting the paradigm from the traditionally private and closed producer
(Baldwin and Hippel 
<a href="#ref-Baldwin2011">2011</a>). Consequently, this new
regime of exploitation/exploration of the environment deeply challenges
the conditioning of both constructs. The blur is stronger if one
considers that the entry-level of open-innovation practices in firms
consists in managing a pool of established and potential suppliers to be
more vigilant to changes coming from the downstream value-chain.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    This shift in the locus of change management encourages to revise the
nature of choices to be made to support innovation management at the
light of the environment turbulence, and organizational boundaries
nuances. How should organization prepare and organize such loci of
innovation? How should executives build up and regenerate competencies
given the multiple project trajectories?
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="competence-building-nesting-innovation-and-organizational-metabolism">Competence building: nesting innovation and organizational metabolism?</h3>
<p>The nature of dynamic capabilities could be split into two adaptive and
creative ones according to (Nonaka, Hirose, and Takeda

<a href="#ref-Nonaka2016">2016</a>). They also need to be tailored and designed to
address such turbulence and complexity. These routines (Zollo and Winter

<a href="#ref-Zollo2002">2002</a>) embedded in the firm may be subject to
path-dependency, requiring to regenerate the dynamic capabilities
themselves; as the latter represent the ability to renew competencies in
order to sustain the environmental fit (Teece, Pisano, and Shuen

<a href="#ref-Teece1997">1997</a>). This recombination or regeneration of a higher
level deeply questions the means to achieve this extraction from
potential lock-ins (Bessant, Stamm, and Moeslein

<a href="#ref-Bessant2011">2011</a>).</p>
<p>What appears critical for such capability enabling the &ldquo;renewal of the
renewal&rdquo; of competencies supporting organizational adaptation, could be
seen in the management of the unknown. The open innovation context
showcases numerous proxies channelling the innovation effort (Howells

<a href="#ref-Howells2006">2006</a>), so the participation to intermediation allows
addressing collectively the risks and opportunities of generating new
knowledge and accreting it (Agogué et al. 
<a href="#ref-Agogue2017">2017</a>). For
instance, by connecting, ad-hoc networks are created to collectively
commit to innovation, creation of legitimate place for collective
innovation (not a shared vision), sharing an agenda of open issues and
questions before sharing knowledge and potential answers.</p>
<p>The case of the semi-conductor industry, joining forces to address the
unknown, reveals how they constitute a new path through clever
road-mapping activities supporting the generation of knowledge (Le
Masson et al. 
<a href="#ref-LeMasson2012">2012</a>). These phenomena also require a
specific analysis to understand the structuration process taking place
in such networks (Sydow et al. 
<a href="#ref-Sydow2012">2012</a>) where hierarchy
is replaced by heterarchy reconsidering the leadership role around
collective roadmap activities: e.g. creation and gap filling
(Müller-Seitz and Sydow 
<a href="#ref-Muller-Seitz2012">2012</a>; Lange et al.

<a href="#ref-Lange2013">2013</a>).</p>
<p>Partnering with other firms are effectively a means to explore novel
fields, but the underlying cooperation relies on necessary coordination
mechanisms as well as cohesion. This mix was identified as crucial to
support collective action (Segrestin 
<a href="#ref-Segrestin2005">2005</a>). It
also reveals critical questions on the legal framework supporting such
open-ended processes thus avoiding rigidities and formalism of
traditional business contracts. The lack of identification and tooling
for path-dependence and path-creation, be it collective or not, can lead
to a standstill as it is the case for orphan innovation (Agogué, Le
Masson, and Robinson 
<a href="#ref-Agogue2012a">2012</a>) and under-performing
technologies biased by government-led incentives (Nemet

<a href="#ref-Nemet2009">2009</a>).</p>
<p>Consequently, understanding through a relational and interactionist
lens, the management of genuine uncertainties, and the unknown in such
partnerships, alliances and networks becomes critical. It requires also
to distance from pure governance or contractual perspectives despite
being crucial, not only to reduce the costs and uncertainty associated
with incomplete knowledge (Sydow, Müller-Seitz, and Provan

<a href="#ref-Sydow2013">2013</a>). For instance, the existence of collectives such
as the famous Lunar Society of Birmingham (1765-1813) exhibits the
capacity to organize beyond the firm’s boundaries into the gaps of the
ecosystem left by the unknown (Le Masson and Weil

<a href="#ref-LeMasson2014">2014</a>). Such groups materialize the links between
science and industry, in order to collectively define new problems,
address what is invisible, in contrast with the existing. Interfering in
such way &ldquo;into&rdquo; the firm’s environment allows guiding the action logics
towards what is potentially manageable with potential innovators (Neyer,
Bullinger, and Moeslein 
<a href="#ref-Neyer2009">2009</a>). Sociotechnical
imaginaries can thus be managed to stimulate the ecosystem at stake
(Hooge and Le Du 
<a href="#ref-Hooge2016a">2016</a>) echoing at higher level the
use of metaphors to drive radical product development. This approach is
relieved from the flexibility and dynamic responses expected from the
firm as they generate a new space in its networks (Grant

<a href="#ref-Grant1996">1996</a>).</p>
<p>Now, the idea of the higher level capabilities called <em>regenerative
dynamic capabilities</em> (Ambrosini, Bowman, and Collier

<a href="#ref-Ambrosini2009">2009</a>, S15) could perhaps be embodied as it frames
how firms &ldquo;<em>might modify and extend their current dynamic
capabilities</em>&quot;. But this third-loop of learning (Leifer and Steinert

<a href="#ref-Leifer2011">2011</a>; McClory, Read, and Labib

<a href="#ref-McClory2017">2017</a>) shows the issue of iterating the looping
process as path-dependency looms again at different loop levels. The
pattern can reach for the <em>hyper-environment</em> by promoting a change of
leadership and external change agents. The trick comes from the
environment cognition seen at different management levels or for
different activities. Hence, it is critical to master the ability to
identify the fixation effects associated with the product design, the
environment, institutions but also organization design.</p>
<p>By reconsidering the importance of action for human cognition (Barsalou

<a href="#ref-Barsalou2016">2016</a>), we have another argument in favour of the
role of design or generative processes in general. Action allows a
better understanding of the environment’s perception and its dynamics.
The notion of <em>cognitive fit</em> (Martignoni, Menon, and Siggelkow

<a href="#ref-Martignoni2016">2016</a>) between mental-model of the decision-maker
and the strategic environment, can then be studied to see if it
contributes positively/negatively to exploration.</p>
<p>They show that cognitive style (simplifier vs. complexifier) will be
better suited for different hierarchical levels (respectively lower and
upper). The decision-making for strategic leadership should rely on a
complexifier cognitive style in an inter-organizational context and high
uncertainty levels (and inversely):</p>

<p>The performance perception combined with the interdependence
representation, will then contribute to more or less exploration which
in return should encourage a more or less efficient choice in the real
performance landscape. However, this association should be carefully
handled, as we have also stressed that too much exploration does not
guarantee stationary payoffs (Posen and Levinthal

<a href="#ref-Posen2012">2012</a>). So the direction of generative processes could
be guided to inquire and interfere with the environment. Evaluating
objects at the frontier of a knowledge domain also reveals several
biases consistent with prospect theory and bounded rationality (Boudreau
et al. 
<a href="#ref-Boudreau2014">2016</a>): lower scores for closer domains, and
the more novel prospects are associated with lower evaluations. It marks
again the edges of optimization and search models, and leaves room for
generative processes supported by design reasoning to articulate
performance ands its renewal.</p>
<p>Coming back to the decision of exploring and exploiting, several
parameters are to be considered: guiding exploration project and
engaging with the environment, loci of innovation, but also the
project-based organization change. Structure and processes are
off-balanced by project trajectories. Since, we relied on several
biological analogies. The concept of metabolism could be another way of
formulating these management parameters.</p>
<p>The word extends and stresses the meaning of <em>metabole</em> which means
<em>change</em> from the Greek $\mu \epsilon \tau \alpha \beta o \lambda \eta$,
itself derived from the prefix <em>meta-</em> (with, communal, in between,
after) and the noun <em>bole</em> (throw, cast and also wiggle or dance<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>).
So coming back to other introduced borrowed words (ecology of
generativity, epicormic offshoot and mutation), the metabolism is a
<em>process</em> that is rather in between organs and physiology.</p>
<p>For instance, the immune system, among other metabolic &ldquo;devices&rdquo;,
generate numerous leucocytes (white blood cells) thanks to DNA
variations in order to create cells that are potentially able to fight
against threats detected in the body. It shows the capacity of creating
deviant cells (different DNA) which should be eliminated per se, but
that needed to potentially generating the adequate defence (Hallé

<a href="#ref-Halle2004">2004</a> XX). This small example gives an idea of the
different nature of metabolism by opposition to other processes
operating in a organic system.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>Finally, a developed environment cognition properly building
capabilities supporting innovation faces the daunting task of generating
choices and selecting them to probe interactions, interdependencies that
are potentially distributed across several loci of innovation.
Sustaining organization metabolism, embedding innovation practices and
organization change, could be a side-effect managed by exploration
management. These metabolisms could then contribute to organizational
ambidexterity.</p>
<p>A gap between exploration project management and models of ambidexterity
has been widening. As a matter of fact, the original aim of
organizational learning and adaptation was founded on a different
assumption of organization design. Project management and project-based
organization bring new dynamics that are not fully compatible as
described so far with previous models of ambidexterity. Several roles
such as intermediaries, roadmaps, sociotechnical imaginaries, and
gap-filling are potential clues to guide the cognitive fit and
generative fit.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we are left with several unanswered question on the
management of fixation effect relative to cognition, the decomposition
of tasks, the update and extension of representations and organization
design. These questions will also have different weights and change in
nature depending if they are considered at the project level, the
program level or its governance. We consequently underline the
complexity of metabolism but also the importance to manage them to
sustain ambidexterity and innovation practices. Otherwise, these
practices could be phased out given their assumptions.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-conclusion-projects-as-generative-vehicles-unsettling-organization-learning-and-design">Chapter conclusion: projects as generative vehicles unsettling organization learning and design</h2>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>In this second chapter of the literature review, we started by looking
at projects as vehicles to search for novelty. It introduced an
encapsulated way of dealing with collective action and ambidexterity.
The unknown is at the heart of and encapsulated in projects. The
separation between exploration and exploitation is addressed with new
concerns for organizational learning and adaption.</p>
<p>This perspective brought a new way of thinking of adaptation and
interactions with the environment. The projectification of economy and
the refinements of the matrix organizational form have put to the fore
temporary organizations creating ties for project-based management. Such
temporary structure may not be fully phased with underlying functional
organization that takes care of legacy product designs, associated
knowledge management and control of technical and organization
interdependencies as they are mirrored.</p>
<p>The generativity associated with exploration projects may push the
temporary organization to a point where ties may be hard to understand
and justify. Projects may then float and anchoring them implies high
levels of reconfigurability of the organizations whilst taking on board
value management and numerous contingencies. The notion of <em>generative
fit</em> becomes quite handy to merge design management closer to
organization design.</p>
<p>Moreover, the project-based organization requires careful management to
handle multiple projects at once, which should not be considered as
isolated phenomena. The refinements brought by portfolio management and
program management allow stretching the collective action encapsulated
in projects in a more easier way towards innovation and strategic
management. We have also stressed that the history of project management
is actually closer to innovation than to optimization-inspired methods.
The governance associated to this unit of analysis reveals the
environment cognition, and the associated <em>cognitive fit</em> to be
maintained. The subsequent allocation of resources, decomposition of
tasks, problem formulation and strategic decision-making become rather
complex as it can be addressing several loci of innovation.</p>
<p>The systems engineering and tradition of detailed product development
literature have had the tendency to specify the way in which design
issues are dealt at technical level but also at the organizational and
social level. The importance of interdependencies and the way in which
temporary organizations or project management offices or even governance
could play with raises intriguing perspectives to conduct collective
action for innovation management. Not only twisting technical
interdependencies play a major role for product development but with the
organizational partial mirroring the change management comes closer to
actual project management. The nature of decision-making that we had
addressed in the first chapter takes now a whole different colour.</p>
<p>Finally, the encapsulation of generative processes in project management
brings a different perspective of organization design and sustainable
innovation management. Advanced forms of the matrix organization with
temporary organization supporting project management or even change
project, raises numerous issues on the way the generativity of product
design practices can be conducted simultaneously with the dynamics and
change requirements of the host organizations. The tensions identified
not only fall dramatically into the realm of contingency and
difficulties to conduct managerial action, but it raises the potential
impact of fixation effects and interdependencies which are usually
targeted by efficient generative processes. Drawing from complexity
theory, fixation points and interdependencies knots could be viewed as
attractors where collective action anchors and burgeons. Consequently,
it would be interesting to see how projects can be driven by shifting
these attractors whilst managing their influence area.</p>
<p>The following chapter will review our findings made in the literature in
order to synthetically specify the three presented models and our
research questions.</p>
