          <div class="article-style">
            <p>Our PhD journey had started from a literature review questioning models
of ambidexterity at the light of the unknown. Innovation management puts
an emphasis on generating novelties, practicing innovative design, and
using methods who actively embrace the unknown. Since implementing an
ambidextrous organization has become rather common - and it was rooted
on the assumptions of (March 
<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>) model - academics
have recently notified the risk that the separation between exploration
and exploitation could bear numerous complexities requiring further
qualitative studies (Birkinshaw and Gupta 
<a href="#ref-Birkinshaw2013">2013</a>;
Gupta, Smith, and Shalley 
<a href="#ref-Gupta2006">2006</a>; Benner and Tushman

<a href="#ref-Benner2015">2015</a>; O’Reilly and Tushman 
<a href="#ref-OReilly2013">2013</a>).
Over the years and with developments in innovation management, the
unknown has conquered the grounds of ambidexterity and its problem-based
foundations.</p>
<p>We have addressed these open statements and calls for research by
revealing several projects in a conglomerate of SMEs, Zodiac Aerospace.
These cases were somehow at odds with predictions of ambidexterity
models. Indeed, exploration projects, which actively engage with the
unknown, stretch beyond what the non-mutual conditioning between
exploration/exploitation is capable of explaining. We have shown that
ambidexterity can effectively kill innovation as it enforces
organization design conformity and a reductive adaptation to exploit
explorations. In the case of ZA and its engineering and marketing
conditions, we explain such phenomenon by product/organization design
fixations and interdependencies that are partially ignored and left
unmanaged.</p>
<p>Consequently, we have proposed a model revisiting the foundations of
exploration/exploitation. With the help of design theories staging
generative processes, we were able to address the design of decisions,
leading to decision-making and coordination of collective action.
Decisional ambidexterity relies on the <em>mutual conditioning between
exploration and exploitation</em> to generate alternatives and states of
nature laying the ground work for interactions on: the nature of
decisions, and models of thought ruling decisions, engineering and
organization design. Working out organization/product design fixations
and interdependencies, with the dynamic mirroring of engineering,
provides additional knowledge to elaborate on the potential decisions
framing collective action.</p>
<p>The ambidexterity re-developed in our model is placed back at a
behavioural level with decision-design seen as a <em>naturally</em> managed and
interactive process perhaps even more salient than actual
decision-making (Christiansen and Varnes 
<a href="#ref-Christiansen2007">2007</a>).
We were able to reinterpret the management anomalies of ZA with a better
understanding of organization design fixations and interdependencies
that were more or less managed and targeted in the management of
exploration project.</p>
<p>Finally, two other projects and the study of a management device
(Multi-BU Committee) enabled testing the model. We thus confirmed the
value of previously hidden variables and offered new predictions. We
then had opportunities to test in vivo decisional ambidexterity with
several heuristics and practices with an exploration project. Moreover,
we formalized some of them in the quality management system procedures
for Innovation and Development. These practices were also validated and
complemented by interactions with the community of R&amp;T Managers.</p>
<p>All in all, the last stretch of the PhD journey allowed to touch upon
the organizational metabolism and how decisional ambidexterity could
sustain the associated generative interactions around decisions and
organizational change.</p>

    <p>In this chapter, we come back on the main contributions of this PhD
thesis with respect to the literature we have surveyed from the
beginning and discussed during our modelling effort (see <a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part4/">part</a>).</p>
<p>Decisional ambidexterity brings an extended view of decision-making by
actively managing the design of alternatives. It brings several decision
categories which reveals different action regimes and means of
coordinating collective action. Exploration project management can
consequently be revisited through this model. We propose to have
systematic ways to sustain innovation with a hacking philosophy.</p>
<p>Decisional ambidexterity offers a way of resurfacing organization and
product design fixations, as well as interdependencies. By doing so,
exploration projects can actively target learning, knowledge management,
and we could even say unknowledge management since we are concerned by
innovative design. Furthermore, the organizational mirroring of product
engineering is embedded through the decision-design process.
Consequently, the associated organizational change, competencies
evolution and generation, organization redesign are naturally mirrored
as potential categorized decisions are envisioned.</p>

<h2 id="decisional-ambidexterity-for-exploration-project-management">Decisional ambidexterity for exploration project management</h2>
<p>Our modelling effort on ambidexterity an its organization started anew
with the foundational work of James March (March

<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>). His original intent for organizational learning
and adaptation was based on problem-solving and the bounded rationality
of agents exploiting routines or exploring new ones. The balance of both
regimes was a starting point for a rich literature on ambidexterity in
organizational studies, strategic management as well as innovation.</p>
<p>Over time, the construct was transposed to different research fields in
management and prescribed in practice. However, innovation management
kept developing whilst showcasing generative processes and a keen
interest to managing the unknown. The valuable literature review of
(Wilden et al. 
<a href="#ref-Wilden2018">2018</a>) gives an overview of the
trajectory of the ambidexterity construct. Several key academics have
also made their own assessment on their contributions to the field
(Birkinshaw and Gupta 
<a href="#ref-Birkinshaw2013">2013</a>; Gupta, Smith, and
Shalley 
<a href="#ref-Gupta2006">2006</a>; O’Reilly and Tushman

<a href="#ref-OReilly2013">2013</a>; Benner and Tushman 
<a href="#ref-Benner2015">2015</a>).
They all come to the conclusion that the relationship between
exploration and exploitation requires deeper qualitative studies to
better understand the implementation of ambidexterity. Its
decision-making and managerial capabilities have remained blurry.
Placing exploration and exploitation on a same continuum or not could be
understood in different ways depending on units of analysis (Gupta,
Smith, and Shalley 
<a href="#ref-Gupta2006">2006</a>). Furthermore, innovation was
seen as a potential driver shifting the performance of exploration
and/or exploitation.</p>
<p>At the light of these calls for research, we have studied how the models
of ambidexterity relying on the assumption of the <em>non-mutual
conditioning between exploration and exploitation</em> would behave in the
unknown. The idea was to test whether or not this strong hypothesis
based on problem-solving would hold true in the unknown. Several units
of analysis were based on adaptation or interactionism provided
frameworks for management.</p>
<p>The prospects of exploration project management (Lenfle

<a href="#ref-Lenfle2008">2008</a>) was a good candidate to reconnect with
innovation management and the increasing projectification. Managing the
unknown is one of its main drivers and given an exploitation regime
ruled by a project-based organization, we identified in the literature
potential shortcomings for organizational learning (Lenfle

<a href="#ref-Lenfle2016">2016</a>) and change (Pollack 
<a href="#ref-Pollack2017">2017</a>;
Hornstein 
<a href="#ref-Hornstein2015">2015</a>).</p>
<p>Given the heavily constrained environment of Zodiac Aerospace, this
conglomerate of SMEs offered a rich research field to question the
validity domain of ambidexterity in the unknown. Several exploration
projects and practices were studied revealing anomalies and
opportunities to experiment with a reconciliating model of
ambidexterity.</p>
<h3 id="avoiding-killing-innovation-in-a-constrained-environment">Avoiding killing innovation in a constrained environment</h3>
<p>We have shown that ambidexterity, with its underlying model of
<em>non-mutual conditioning between exploration and exploitation</em>, can
actually kill innovation. The cases reported by Zodiac Aerospace present
a wide range of exploration projects, relying on different generative
processes. Despite having the a priori required elements to transition
these projects, go to market or have business units take over
initiatives, they would be considered as failures with no tomorrow for
exploitation, learning, adaptation, competitive advantage. Some would
only score a few partial points.</p>
<p>These anomalies of ambidexterity can only be understood by reconsidering
the frontier of problems and decisions in the unknown. Design theories
and reasoning bring a new language for decision-making,
problem-formulation and problem-solving. The model <strong>decisional
ambidexterity</strong> provides a new understanding of generative processes,
environment cognition, organization design, as well as collective
action. It allows tracking decisions and their design along a project’s
trajectory.</p>
<p>We have illustrated that an exploration project can succeed in
developing a new product, in a new market, and have several business
units taking a stake in the innovation process to regenerate their
organizations. A careful work of designing decisions and understanding
what makes the decision come true is required through design of the
states of nature: market, environmental constraints, norms, standards,
users’ acceptance, etc. These heuristics of decision-designers provide
them with means of action enabling the materialization of their
innovation effort.</p>
<h3 id="hacking-philosophy-the-decision-designer">Hacking philosophy: the decision-designer</h3>
<p>The philosophy of designing decisions can be related to hacking. Indeed,
applying design theories to decision theories offers new degrees of
freedom on a highly normative model of action. The decision-designer
does what everyone does: we choose from readily accessible alternatives
induced by path-dependency and fixation effects, and if we have or
imagine the consequences, we may be willing to generate new alternatives
and scenarios where we would be as satisfied or even more satisfied.</p>
<p>Of course, this satisfactory level overcomes and twists bounded
rationality (Simon 
<a href="#ref-Simon1955">1955</a>). We would, in fact, extend
our rationality by engaging in actions embodying what is necessary to
realize designed decisions. Instead of choosing A or B given C or D, one
can optimize consequences given a certain belief, but one can also find
a generic solution fitting all outcomes and beliefs. Or one could even
totally aim for different comparable alternatives in another scenario.
One could finally aim for <em>less</em> comparable alternatives as we mix up
other value networks in different scenarios.</p>
<p>Optimization, genericity, and wishful decision by hacking one or all
states of nature sets different courses of action for project
management. The hacking is performed given parameters identified in the
originally given exploitative situation. It helps rooting, nurturing and
making sense of the exploration stretch. Conditioning is no longer seen
as reductive, it is instead expansive when designing.</p>
<p>These statements were tested and validated by practices, discussions,
and accepted in process management procedures. But, they still raise
numerous questions on a synthetic technology of organizing to channel
interactions on the design of decisions and commitment. The need is
perfectly natural: we are tricking probability theory with a
conditioning that in reality implies hacking. Uncertainty is increased
but we counter it with means of action reconfiguring relationships and
knowledge.</p>
<p>It is rather stimulating to think of our modelling effort as a means to
reconnect the rational augmentation hoped by Herbert Simon with the
foolishness and Romantic views of leadership by James March. A conscious
and rational model of thought led by design theory and reasoning could
occupy this grey zone. In other words, our research results targeted the
relationship between rationality and foolishness in (March

<a href="#ref-March2006">2006</a>, 209):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It is argued that the link between rationality and conventional
knowledge keeps rational technologies reliable but inhibits creative
imagination. This characterization seems plausible, but it probably
underestimates the potential contribution of rational technologies to
foolishness and radical visions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this PhD thesis, we developed this bone of contention with the mutual
conditioning between exploration and exploitation. Decisional
ambidexterity, with its decision-design and decision-making in the
unknown, offers a means to rationalize and sustain foolishness in a way.
It cools down a romantic view of decision-making and collective action
in organizations, but we offer in return manageable risks and
opportunities sustaining imagination and creativity in markets (Bronk

<a href="#ref-Bronk2009">2009</a>).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="decisional-ambidexterity-for-organizational-ambidexterity">Decisional ambidexterity for organizational ambidexterity</h2>
<p>Our research made a specific focus on the encapsulated fashion of
project management. It was a means to discuss managing the unknown with
a clear view of how collective action was coordinated and the
assumptions made from an organizational standpoint. Project management
was demonstrated to be historically linked to innovation management
(Davies, Manning, and Söderlund 
<a href="#ref-Davies2018">2018</a>; Lenfle and Loch

<a href="#ref-Lenfle2010">2010</a>, 
<a href="#ref-Lenfle2017">2017</a>). It gave us a baseline
to discuss the relationship between project-based and temporary
organization (Turner 
<a href="#ref-Turner2009">2009</a>; Söderlund and Müller

<a href="#ref-Soderlund2014a">2014</a>; Sydow, Lindkvist, and Defillippi

<a href="#ref-Sydow2004">2004</a>; Bakker et al. 
<a href="#ref-Bakker2016">2016</a>) and
exploration projects (Lenfle 
<a href="#ref-Lenfle2016">2016</a>).</p>
<p>The &ldquo;deconstruction&rdquo; path taken from the model of
exploration/exploitation (March 
<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>), who took us to
discussions on organizational studies, leadership and strategic
management, is now taken backwards to reconnect the encapsulated way of
separating exploration and exploitation with organizational learning and
adaptation. The new perspectives on organization design in (Van de Ven,
Ganco, and Hinings 
<a href="#ref-VandeVen2013">2013</a>; Puranam

<a href="#ref-Puranam2012">2012</a>; Avital and Te’eni 
<a href="#ref-Avital2009">2009</a>) and
change management (Pollack 
<a href="#ref-Pollack2017">2017</a>; Hornstein

<a href="#ref-Hornstein2015">2015</a>) bring additional perspectives on <em>where</em>
projects could interfere. The cruciality of epistemic interdependencies
is flagged as they allow reconnecting with engineering design and its
mirroring hypothesis (Colfer and Baldwin 
<a href="#ref-Colfer2016">2016</a>).</p>
<p>We were interested in organizational learning and change prospects that
tend to be regenerative. This specific feature is given by the heavily
constrained environment of Zodiac Aerospace, with numerous design rules,
standards, norms, and business units mirroring market segments with
associated engineering for certified products. The ecosystem has rather
settled after numerous acquisitions and consolidations. Business Units
have their specific niches and playfields, and are grouped in divisions
and branches for an Executive Committee. Creating spin-offs appeared out
of the equation. It would force (re-)generative learning (Senge

<a href="#ref-Senge1990">1990</a>) and mirrored organizational change to overcome
core rigidities and incompetencies (Leonard-Barton

<a href="#ref-Leonard-Barton1992">1992</a>; Dougherty 
<a href="#ref-Dougherty1995">1995</a>).</p>
<h3 id="organizational-learning-articulated-by-explorationexploitation-mutual-conditioning">Organizational learning articulated by exploration/exploitation mutual conditioning</h3>
<p>We have shown cases where learning was kept isolated from exploitation
because of non-mutual conditioning assumptions. Exploration projects had
however played an active role in cultivating learning and opening new
innovation fields. Some projects even relied on a clear hacking
philosophy of exploitation regime with preferences reversal for
instance.</p>
<p>Learning was also inhibited because of generative processes and project
management not systematically taking on board organization design and
environmental dimensions. Exploration would be conducted for an
<em>iso-exploitation</em> regime and it would expect that operational
organizations would learn from exploration during hand-over. Despite
clever and prepared interactions for transitions, most projects would
not articulate (enough) the exploration-exploitation mutual
conditioning.</p>
<p>Two cases and an intervention allowed however to better identify
learning mechanisms around problem-formulation, value space and open
discussions on future decisions. Decisional ambidexterity model played a
crucial role in forcing learning and shaping the unknown to enable
decisions-making. Means of actions can be derived and a sense of
direction is given for learning. Learning of engineering design rules
and absorption of new knowledge engage decision-designers in the
reconfiguration of organization’s knowledge management. This generative
learning around decision-design would then require new relationships to
be tied.</p>
<h3 id="organizational-adaptation-and-change-driven-by-unlocking-fixations-and-interdependencies">Organizational adaptation and change driven by unlocking fixations and interdependencies</h3>
<p>The studied exploration projects were all potential emergent strategies
from intra or inter BU perspectives. They addressed potential
competitive advantage and adaptation to the environment. However, we
have seen that organizational ambidexterity could potentially inhibit
their prospects. Decisional ambidexterity model surfaces the criticality
of organization design fixations and interdependencies to steer
exploration projects. Otherwise, projects may float and disconnect from
host organizations.</p>
<p>Two contrasted cases revealed the importance of problem formulation and
managing value around what business units are capable of deciding given
their engineering capabilities. Conceptualizing the mirroring hypothesis
(Colfer and Baldwin 
<a href="#ref-Colfer2016">2016</a>), through the design of
decisions and organization design knowledge, forces to merge change
management with project management. It encourages also to find means
(e.g. prototypes, management tools, decisions committees, business
models, etc.) bearing the reconfiguration of relationships and knowledge
through novel designed decisions.</p>
<p>As we have shown in the researcher’s intervention and other
contributions to Zodiac Aerospace, the categorization effort in concepts
and designed decisions offer handles on interdependencies and
organization design fixations. These channelled interactions with an
effort on engineering models and mirrored organizations. They triggered
side-projects and valued positively projects that would otherwise be
simply considered deviant. We insist again on the fact that exploration
is richer and more performant by referring to exploitation. It sustains
an elasticity and plasticity in the conditioning between
exploration/exploitation offering room for organizational metabolism to
thrive.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="chapter-synthesis-decisional-ambidexterity-a-model-for-strategic-innovation-management">Chapter synthesis: decisional ambidexterity, a model for strategic innovation management</h2>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>This penultimate chapter portraits our main results and contributions.
The management anomaly detection revealed and confirmed several
limitations of models of ambidexterity relying on the non-mutual
conditioning between exploration/exploitation. The separation can
effectively kill innovation instead of letting it positively shift the
performance frontier of both regimes. As innovation emerges from the
unknown, its management in exploration projects is the ground for
innovative design and strategic decisions/actions.</p>
<p>In a constrained environment, extremely path-dependent context and
threatened by the unknown, exploration appears more performant and
sustainable in the long run if it is mutually conditioned by
exploitation. Decision-designers can actively play with different
decision categories where hacking is performed on exploitation
parameters generating alternatives and action roadmaps to accomplish
designed decisions.</p>
<p>Decisional ambidexterity allows reconciliating with the drift of
organizational ambidexterity. The initial foundations were on
problem-solving, but with organization studies and strategic management,
it overstretched towards innovation management. The construct changed in
nature up to the point that separating and balancing may no longer be
valid for innovative design practices and managing the unknown.</p>
<p>We consequently provided a novel way of reconnecting to the behavioural
foundations of exploration <em>versus</em> exploitation by working on their
mutual conditioning. It provided us means to sustain innovation efforts,
as well as organizational learning and adaptation. Resurfacing
organization and product design fixations and interdependencies allowed
articulating novelty and steer generativity to simultaneously drive
product development and organizational change.</p>
