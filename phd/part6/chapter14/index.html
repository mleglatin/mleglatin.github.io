          <h1>Chapter 14 - Discussion and perspectives for decisional ambidexterity</h1>

          <div class="article-style">
            <p>In this final chapter, we open up our conclusion for discussions on our
model of decisional ambidexterity and research perspectives. We have so
far reworked the conditioning between exploration and exploitation. This
modulation allows reconnecting models of ambidexterity with managing the
unknown. It holds true that exploration and exploitation should be
mutually conditioned in a constrained environment with rules, norms,
regulations, path dependency sensitive to potential threats of
disruption. It avoids deteriorating both regimes. It actually supports a
sustainable generativity, organizational change and design.</p>
<p>The developed model of decisional ambidexterity tries to reconnect
decision theories with design theories. We have shown how the unknown
could be integrated. With the rising projectification of firms and the
economy, exploration projects heavily discuss organizational learning
and adaptation. Organizational ambidexterity and design implemented by
top management should then be reviewed at the light of meso-level
analyses at work in projects driven by decision-design and the
unknown.</p>
<p>However, designing decisions, from the standpoint of cognitive
psychology and even behavioural economics, can be seen as paradoxical.
For decision-making on one hand, research agendas have studied and
modelled the influence of biases and heuristics (Tversky and Kahneman

<a href="#ref-Tversky1974">1974</a>; Kahneman and Tversky

<a href="#ref-Kahneman1979a">1979</a>; Kahneman 
<a href="#ref-Kahneman2011">2011</a>).
Moreover, different dispositional variables, such as stress or positive
emotions and other conditioning settings can be added to measure their
influence (Cassotti et al. 
<a href="#ref-Cassotti2012">2012</a>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, psychology of creativity has been driven by how
individuals and groups generate ideas. Instead of decision biases, they
would discuss fixation effects and its inhibitory control (Cassotti et
al. 
<a href="#ref-Cassotti2016">2016</a>) on generativity.</p>
<p>These two research streams stand on different grounds. They rely on
different perspectives of rationality and use different experimental
protocols. How could we provide a general model of generation of
alternatives, their selection and commitment? How should experiments be
conducted to grasp design during decision tasks? Like decisional
ambidexterity providing a &ldquo;unifying&rdquo; framework, we would wonder about a
unified theory of generativity and choice. Or at least, we are curious
about pushing both models towards a common asymptote where uncertainty
becomes unknown and where the unknown becomes uncertain.</p>
<p>We have considered hacking practices for decision-designers. All <em>silent
designers</em> in organizations (Dumas and Mintzberg 
<a href="#ref-Dumas1989">1989</a>,

<a href="#ref-Dumas1991">1991</a>) could then offer new means of collective action
for corporate entrepreneurship and radical innovation (O’Connor

<a href="#ref-OConnor2016">2016</a>). Not only is institutionalizing innovation
necessary to recognize the phenomena and avoiding ineffective risk
taking, but it can also be sustained with <em>technologies of organizing</em>.
The importance of valuation tools and methods when designing decisions
would be critical to manage exploration projects but also for
organizations.</p>
<p>The idea of an <em>Organizational Design Thinking</em> would be quite
stimulating. Common design thinking methodology will be fixated by users
and a given ontology of operations in the ecosystem. Tackling users
pains and building empathy helps generating concepts where users can
easily adopt, interact with and open new perspectives.</p>
<p>Could we imagine a decision-design methodology where the purpose is to
promote concepts that systematically address what will federate
organization around a common purpose? It would be a sort of positive
<em>no-man’s land</em> that drives learning and change, instead of fighting for
primacy or against inertia.</p>
<p>The valuation methods would be critical to target the cracks between
organizations and to generate such concepts targeting organizational
constraints and drivers. The Lower Deck project would appear as a
suitable example by contrast with the Connected Cabin (see 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part4/chapter10/">chapter</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, our concern for valuation tools and organizational design
thinking brings us to discuss a renewed organization design: <em>generative
organization design</em>. In the literature, we have pointed at several
authors inviting to rethink this research topic.</p>
<p>The modelling effort concretized into decisional ambidexterity took
organization design as knowledge to generate new concepts and keep an
eye on mirroring dynamics. There would not be any target organization
design since we focus on engineering design and decisions. For open
innovation, problem formulation and solving will be driven through a
decision-design practice. Partnering with users, suppliers, integrators
and even competitors would have a different twist. Separate and
interconnected agendas could support different decision categories
engaged with the environment.</p>
<p>If designed decisions drive organization re-design, what would be the
managerial action in such context? What is the governance of such
distributed and generative innovation function?</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>Firstly, the decisional ambidexterity model developed in our thesis and
in two articles (Le Masson et al. <a href="#ref-LeMasson2018">2018</a>; Le Glatin,
Le Masson, and Weil <a href="#ref-LeGlatin2017a">2017</a>) raises several questions
and perspectives on how the frontier can be bridged between cognitive
psychology for decision-making and creativity. The theoretical
implications are critical for both fields when pushing their models to a
common asymptote of unknown/uncertainty. It questions also
experimentation means to think of decisions upon generated and given
choices.</p>
<p>Secondly, the spirit of hacking we have promoted around decisions,
interdependencies and organization/product design fixations effects,
encourages to rethink valuation methods and methodology to drive
exploration project management in a cluster of firms. An <em>Organizational
Design Thinking</em> would help formalizing methods specifically targeting
organizational learning and adaptation around concepts carefully
designed based on existing exploitation regimes in organizations.</p>
<p>Lastly, we reconsider the concept of generative organization design with
the reconfigurability driven by innovative design in engineering
projects. We discuss also how the engineering design practice can embed
the concern to overcome and manage organization design fixations.</p>
  </div>

<h2 id="a-bridge-between-decision-and-generativity">A bridge between decision and generativity</h2>
<p>When facing a decision task, alternatives are given to the
decision-maker. However, we have brought forward that in the course of
action, rational choice of theory has several limitations (Le Glatin, Le
Masson, and Weil 
<a href="#ref-LeGlatin2017a">2017</a>). One could be <em>irrational</em>
with respect to several paradoxes that can be embraced in prospect
theory for instance (Kahneman and Tversky 
<a href="#ref-Kahneman1979a">1979</a>).
Reversing preferences in time or willingly complexifies the
understanding of decision-making (Slovic 
<a href="#ref-Slovic1995">1995</a>;
Camerer, Loewenstein, and Rabin 
<a href="#ref-Camerer2004">2004</a>; Machina

<a href="#ref-Machina1989">1989</a>; Chabris, Laibson, and Schuldt

<a href="#ref-Chabris2006">2006</a>).</p>
<p>For decision theories stemming and extending the works of Abraham Wald
(Wald 
<a href="#ref-Wald1949">1949</a>; Savage 
<a href="#ref-Savage1954">1954</a>; Giocoli

<a href="#ref-Giocoli2013">2013</a>; Fourcade and Khurana

<a href="#ref-Fourcade2013">2013</a>), inconsistency or intransitivity are
violations of rationality. A simple way of accepting such violation is
the integration of new information in time. Otherwise, considering that
the decision-maker generates new decisions and actions, to gain
information given a bounded problem, unsettles rational theories of
choice.</p>
<h3 id="bounding-and-unbounding-problems">Bounding and unbounding problems</h3>
<p>Rational theories of choice, operational research and refinements
brought by cognitive psychology have taken a rationally bounded
perspective on agents. A problem would be predefined, the agent will
struggle to oversee the full landscape and will follow the <em>path of
least resistance</em> and be biased. However, the perspectives from
creativity theory or generativity theory (Epstein et al.

<a href="#ref-Epstein1984">1984</a>; Epstein 
<a href="#ref-Epstein1990">1990</a>,

<a href="#ref-Epstein1999">1999</a>) tend to unbound problems or at least
reformulate them. New decisions can be designed and engaged given
problem parameters; it was the case for pigeons solving their problem.
In a more ill-defined setting, design can not only optimize, find
generic solutions or recombine, it can also revamp altogether the
problem at stake.</p>
<p>The question for us would be to understand what are the parameters that
would trigger the need to design instead of simply deciding. Is it
comparable to risk aversion/seeking behaviours? The major difference is
when designing, an active interaction is engaged with the environment
instead of a passive one expecting for the states of nature to reveal.
The decision-designer would hope to generate new knowledge and tie new
relationships.</p>
<p>The issue is with the very construction of probabilities. Imprecision
and fuzzy sets could be a first patch. Unfortunately, they do not model
the reconfiguration and complete revaluation of alternatives and states
of nature. Even if a theoretical effort is required for theories of
behaviour, extending for instance prospect theory with design reasoning,
we could also turn towards experimentation’s means.</p>
<h3 id="differences-in-experimental-protocols">Differences in experimental protocols</h3>
<p>Our interest would be in the inhibitors and triggers for designing
decisions. Some situations could be intolerable for decision-making,
perhaps they could support the generation of other alternatives
countering a priori consequences. Moral judgement and ethical behaviour
could be an exciting approach to unlock the deliberate will to design
decisions instead of deciding.</p>
<p>For instance, the trolley problem extensively studied by Judith Thomson
(Thomson 
<a href="#ref-Thomson1976">1976</a>, 
<a href="#ref-Thomson1985">1985</a>,

<a href="#ref-Thomson2008">2008</a>) could be an interesting baseline to discuss
the design of new alternatives and what could trigger it. This problem
also concerns autonomous driving (Bonnefon, Shariff, and Rahwan

<a href="#ref-Bonnefon2015">2016</a>). The matter is given in an iso-environment
for the car, whereas it could be perhaps even more stimulating to think
of autonomous cars actively protecting pedestrians (i.e. not just with
shock absorbers, sensors to detect the variety of obstacles and
pedestrians and deciding).</p>
<p>The difficulty in approaching experimentation at the frontier of
decision and creativity is the protocol and briefs given to the
decider/designer. It may totally inhibit one or the other whereas we
would be more curious about the comings and goings between the two.
Since the <em>Centre de Gestion Scientifique</em> has a partnership with the
<em>LabPsyDé</em> of Descartes University, we already had several discussions
on these topics with Anaëlle Camarda and Matthieu Cassotti. We had some
ideas for moral judgement, studying the anchoring effects of Kahneman
and Tversky with respect to design, but also biases for negative
conditioning and asking for information like in Wason’s experiment
(Wason 
<a href="#ref-Wason1960">1960</a>; Houdé and Moutier

<a href="#ref-Houde1996">1996</a>).</p>
<h3 id="reexplaining-behaviours-biases-heuristics-and-hacking">Reexplaining behaviours: biases, heuristics and hacking</h3>
<p>Furthermore, designing decisions in the unknown encourages the decider
to interact and interfere with his beliefs and states of nature. Biases
and heuristics could contribute to the dominant design and fixation
effects. However, decision hacking with genericity and wishful decisions
reveal another behaviour providing a more positive and pro-active
feature of rationality.</p>
<p>With the increasing number of practices promoted in start-up
environment, we wonder how we could study in more detail the behaviours
associated with effectuation (Sarasvathy 
<a href="#ref-Sarasvathy2001">2001</a>;
Agogué, Lundqvist, and Middleton 
<a href="#ref-Agogue2015">2015</a>), lean start-up
(Ries 
<a href="#ref-Ries2011a">2011</a>; Blank 
<a href="#ref-Blank2013">2013</a>), growth
hacking, incompleteness by design (Garud, Jain, and Tuertscher

<a href="#ref-Garud2008">2008</a>) and platform strategies (Gawer and Cusumano

<a href="#ref-Gawer2014">2014</a>). The practices could easily be explained with
decision-design and they could also benefit from research on cognitive
psychology around the heuristics developed to make and design decisions
in entrepreneurship and early-stage decision-making.</p>
<p>These comments are also valid for finance in venture capitalism and
private equity. From early-stage to A/B/C/D rounds, investments are also
promising grounds to understand the logics of decisions, information
gathering and influence on strategy through corporate governance bodies.
Hopefully, some answers will be found in the PhD results of Laure-Anne
Parpaleix (<em>Centre Gestion Scientifique</em>, Mines ParisTech, and CIFRE
contract with BPI France).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="organizational-design-thinking-and-management-devices">Organizational Design Thinking and management devices</h2>
<p>The model of decisional ambidexterity offers a valuable basis to track
and explain projects. It can also be used to derive means of actions and
valuation practices. However, it would be interesting to reconnect with
existing methodologies and management tools providing valuation for
decision-making and action.</p>
<p>Methods like platform engineering and Design Thinking were referred to
in two case studies. The first has a strong logic on economic evaluation
with modularity benefits (Sanchez and Mahoney 
<a href="#ref-Sanchez1996">1996</a>).
The second builds on user empathy and generative practices incorporating
such knowledge. We have revealed that both were minored by outdated
models of ambidexterity. However, it would encourage to <em>engineer</em>
heuristics and valuation methods in order to steer their generativity
countering the limitations of organizational ambidexterity. In the
philosophy of hacking, we would prefer thinking of Judo or Aikido moves
where light imbalances are turned into an advantage. It echoes the
<em>phronesis</em> (Nonaka, Hirose, and Takeda 
<a href="#ref-Nonaka2016">2016</a>), and
<em>sensing, seizing and reconfiguring</em> of (Teece 
<a href="#ref-Teece2007">2007</a>).
This economic vigilance would use organization design fixation effects
and valuation tools to guide Design Thinking and platform architecture.
This vigilance would consequently guide exploration project management.</p>
<h3 id="from-user-pains-and-needs-to-recombination-of-organizational-routines">From user pains and needs to recombination of organizational routines</h3>
<p>The divergent and convergent phases, with multiple feedback loops of
Design Thinking could also be driven by organizational design. We have
shown that their fixations can be hard to overcome because of external
biases, so it is worth endogenizing such constraints to generate new
alternatives and concepts.</p>
<p>For instance, the Design Thinking cases, by comparison with the later
Lower Deck project, show the importance of problem formulation, concept
positioning, decision enablers and value space. These elements were part
of the <em>innovation potential of attraction</em> descriptor. The Lower Deck
project formulated a concept that would overcome several limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>BUs will struggle to see the value of working around a common
purpose</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BUs will takeover the full project for primacy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BUs engineering and marketing departments may not able to value
learning and adaptation to a whole new environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BUs will prefer waiting for the clients to manifest new use cases
and new ecosystems interdependencies, instead of proposing new ones</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Lower Deck built upon the lessons and attempts of previous projects,
where it was a design feature or enabler for other functional
objectives. However, by managing its value temporarily in a empty space
unoccupied by BUs, the concept managed to create sufficient attraction
for business units to federate along a common purpose of learning and
recombining their engineering routines. Indeed, constraining
certification and market demand were shaped in a way that organizational
barriers can be lowered.</p>
<p>In other words, an <em>Organizational Design Thinking</em> would specifically
target what organizations can’t do on their own. However, it is not a
simple technology to be outsourced and integrated. The Connected Cabin
project highlighted these limitations. Instead, the concepts aim for
reconfiguring interdependencies between BUs, engineering rules and
interfaces, as well as the ecosystem. It is not driven by organization
pains, but it would focus on existing organization design and routines.
One could then search for <em>cracks</em> left by interdependencies and design
systematically what BUs can’t do by themselves. We would be thrilled to
study these areas with Lisa Carlgren (Chalmers University) and Katharina
Hölzle.</p>
<h3 id="valuation-methods-innovation-potential">Valuation methods: innovation potential</h3>
<p>A means to drive the generation of concepts and potential decisions
could also around valuation methods. The mutual-conditioning between
exploration and exploitation would inspire us to look simply on existing
tools and devices. Relying on <em>net present value</em> calculations, business
plans and real options could offer numerous opportunities for designing
new alternatives and concepts corresponding to hacked valuation methods.</p>
<p>For instance, if several scenarios are presented for a business plan
(e.g. pessimistic, nominal and optimistic), one could design
alternatives offering them complementary background and comparison. But,
the designed decisions could help to think of what should be done for
the most favourable scenario. This design practice forces to interact
differently with the formalism expected from valuation methods. Problems
are inverted. In that perspective, we hope the PhD works of Agathe
Gillain (<em>Centre de Gestion Scientifique</em>, CIFRE contract at Airbus)
will provide some answers on the economic performance of R&amp;D investments
with respect to learning strategies for example.</p>
<p>One of the members of the R&amp;T community had reported developing a
selection tools for concepts. Not only would it filter them based on
criteria agreed with stakeholders, but they also planned in having a
derived scoring that would warn decision-makers to reformulate some
concept’s acceptance. In other words, besides filtering, some concepts
would trigger to imagine of different states of nature and criteria to
accept them. Consequently, it forces stakeholders to review their
department’s capabilities, knowledge and relationships across
interfaces.</p>
<p>All in all, our perspective on valuation is that decisional
ambidexterity and the hacking philosophy promoted with decision-design
in the unknown, could support exploration project management. What is
even more exciting is that we would use exploitation frameworks to
articulate the exploration regime and generative processes. The distance
between the two regimes could be measured through this clever
conditioning with performance criteria traditionally used. It would
avoid isolation between the two as they would use a common language and
management tools but have a different relationship to these artefacts.</p>
<p>The intervention for Hypoxia Protection project revealed the usefulness
and generativity of such heuristics applied to product conformity
matrices (e.g. house of quality) and technical feasibility and
performance (e.g. physical measures). In the sociology and ethnography
literature, we would also look for echoes of this dual relationship with
management devices for exploitation nurturing exploration and preparing
its acceptance. It could offer new actions means for marketing as the
level unknow heavily contests existing relationships. For instance, the
works of Liliana Doganova (Centre for the Sociology of Innovation, Mines
ParisTech) on the performativity of valuation devices could be revisited
with generativity practices. This concern for exploration project
valuation could also be refined in the future with the ongoing works of
Svenja Sommer, Kathrin Möslein and Sylvain Lenfle.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="generative-organization-design-and-governance">Generative organization design and governance</h2>
<p>For this final section, we will address organization design and
governance based on the previous discussions. The cognition, interaction
and valuation conveyed in decisional ambidexterity opened stimulating
areas to reflect on. Earlier in the manuscript, we had taken a keen
interest on organization design and its practice. The conglomerate of
SMEs, Zodiac Aerospace, had stressed this dimension for engineering,
marketing, market arrangements and group strategic decision-making.
Since, the field is willing to renew itself (Barry

<a href="#ref-Barry2011">2011</a>; Van de Ven, Ganco, and Hinings

<a href="#ref-VandeVen2013">2013</a>), we propose to discuss its relationship with
generative processes at work for the Innovation function.</p>
<p>The influence of managing as design (Boland and Collopy

<a href="#ref-Boland2004">2004</a>), as discussed in our literature review, can be
bring a different viewpoint on organization design (Romme

<a href="#ref-Romme2003">2003</a>). The place given to generative processes
scattered across the firm, like the existence of <em>silent designers</em>
(Dumas and Mintzberg 
<a href="#ref-Dumas1989">1989</a>; Dumas

<a href="#ref-Dumas1994">1994</a>), can easily allow us to think of design-driven
organizations. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the firm focuses on
design services, nor that design methodologies are institutionalized
such as firms having embraced Design Thinking, C-K Theory.</p>
<p>However, we would rather be leaning towards a weaker form of design
reasoning distributed across the firm, cultivated by the mutual
conditioning between exploration and exploitation. In other words, we
would <span class="underline">not</span> organize collective action for
a target organization design. We would instead prefer offering the
management tools and managerial philosophy through a specific governance
for innovation. The organization will design <em>itself</em> through clearly
managed devices, decision-design and a overarching governance body
overlooking this fractal organization (Nonaka et al.

<a href="#ref-Nonaka2014">2014</a>).</p>
<h3 id="governance-of-innovation-function---problem-re-formulation">Governance of Innovation function - problem re-formulation</h3>
<p>Having a simple rule and heuristic constantly challenging and designing
decisions could be used as a pattern to generate organization designs in
non-deterministic fashion. Problems are constantly reformulated and
solved but without relying specifically on leadership or top management
as suggested by (Lakhani, Lifshitz-Assaf, and Tushman

<a href="#ref-Lakhani2013">2013</a>).</p>
<p>A culture of design and decision would be formalized through the dual
relationship of mutual-conditioning of exploration/exploitation regimes.
Re-articulating the decisions and problems vertically, among internal
stakeholders but also with the <em>exterior</em>, raises questions on the
nature of innovation function’s governance. The writings for the ZAOS
<em>Innovate</em> process addressed such heuristics around the overly famous
innovation funnel. We realized that beyond the institutionalization of
the innovation function (O’Connor 
<a href="#ref-OConnor2016">2016</a>) and
associated practices reported by R&amp;T managers and in projects, having a
governance body for innovation could emphasize the strategic importance
of concepts and their associated decision-design scoping. The Multi-BU
committee could have been a corporate example. Problems being
reformulated and solved by managing the unknown would require to
re-engineer interdependencies echoing its organization design
mirroring.</p>
<p>We would encourage to continue these discussions with Dominique Laousse,
Head of Foresight and Innovative Group at SNCF. He recently defended his
PhD at the <em>Centre de Gestion Scientifique</em> under the supervision of
Sophie Hooge and Armand Hatchuel. Looking back on the deployment of the
innovation function at SNCF, he proposes a staged analysis: from
institutionalization, to industrialization (with innovative design
projects derived from C-K theory - DKCP) and up to organization and
governance. This governance topic reflects also the works of Blanche
Segrestin, Kevin Levillain and Armand Hatchuel on purpose-driven
companies. Some teachings could possibly be drawn from the ongoing PhD
thesis of Jeremy Levêque on firms’ <em>mission drift</em>.</p>
<h3 id="governance-of-innovation-function---design-oriented-organization">Governance of Innovation function - design-oriented organization</h3>
<p>This extreme reconfigurability organized around a new relationship to
decision-making by decision-design could perhaps preliminary
perspectives to the multi-dimensional organizations (Galbraith

<a href="#ref-Galbraith2010">2010</a>). However, there is no target organization
design managed and prescribed. Local action through projects, designed
decisions and a governance body would sustain new relationships with the
environment. This generativity theory of organizing (Van de Ven, Ganco,
and Hinings 
<a href="#ref-VandeVen2013">2013</a>), clearly endogenizes change
management in project management (Pollack 
<a href="#ref-Pollack2017">2017</a>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, it places the unknown at the heart of management. Managers
transfer, solve, and formulate problems that those who report to them
can’t solve given their knowledge and relationships. A governance body,
dedicated to the unknown through decision-design, would manage its
cognition of the environment and strategic health check-up. These
perspectives were foreshadowed in the works of Henri Fayol (Fayol

<a href="#ref-Fayol1916">1916</a>). It is worth pointing out that many would only
retain the control and regulation roles of Fayol’s management principles
(Turner and Keegan 
<a href="#ref-Turner2001">2001</a>; Hodgson

<a href="#ref-Hodgson2004">2004</a>; Olin and Wickenberg 
<a href="#ref-Olin2001">2001</a>),
whereas he would also insist on strategic knowledge management,
relationships with the ecosystem and scientific work (Hatchuel and
Segrestin 
<a href="#ref-Hatchuel2018">2018</a>; Hatchuel, Le Masson, and Weil

<a href="#ref-Hatchuel2002a">2002</a>). These practices and heuristics would enact
a design-oriented organization (Hatchuel, Weil, and Le Masson

<a href="#ref-Hatchuel2006">2006</a>) giving a different flavour to the <em>generative
fit</em> (Avital and Te’eni 
<a href="#ref-Avital2009">2009</a>). Finally, these
concerns would encourage to reconsider the place of entrepreneurship and
innovation within the organizations with emergent strategies synonymous
with design (Drucker 
<a href="#ref-Drucker1985">1985</a>).</p>

<h2 id="chapter-synthesis-decisional-ambidexterity-a-model-contributing-to-perspectives-opened-in-literature">Chapter synthesis: decisional ambidexterity, a model contributing to perspectives opened in literature</h2>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>In this final chapter, we have opened the discussions towards extensions
of our work. We proposed to do so by articulating them with key readings
already solicited in our literature view. Several stimulation
perspectives are offered to connect this thesis work with ongoing
research and historical writings.</p>
<p>We started with the cognitive psychology and behavioural concern for our
model of decisional ambidexterity. The decision-design needed to extend
decision-making in the unknown calls for future research on theoretical
models, mathematical foundations discussing the definition of
probabilities. A complex task is also ahead of us to experiment and
study the comings and goings between designing and deciding. Some leads
around moral judgement could be a starter for our prospects.</p>
<p>The concept of <em>Organization Design Thinking</em> equipped with relevant
value management tools would also be a stimulating area of research. We
would extend Design Thinking methodologies to interactively foster
generativity around exploitation and organization design fixations.
Exploration projects would target what business units are not able to
do. These organizations would then find a common purpose for working
together. Furthermore, using common language of exploitation and its
limitations could be used in favour of exploration projects and value
management.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the previous perspectives encourage to avoid
thinking of Organization Design as a practice aiming for an organization
target. Instead, the role of generativity in projects quickly challenges
potential strategic decisions requiring more than institutionalization:
a governance body dedicated to the innovation function. Problem
reformulation would be nurtured by the mutual conditioning between
exploration and exploitation. It would orientate the whole organization
altogether towards design: a generative organization design. Governance
would embrace strategy design, intrapreneurship and organization’s
regenerative capabilities through the overarching vigilance of
decision-design.</p>
