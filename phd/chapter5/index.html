<p>In this chapter, we start by presenting the aviation industry market and
specially the context of equipment manufacturers with current challenges
for this ecosystem (section
<a href="#sec:presentation_market" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:presentation_market">1</a>).
We insist through its history the nature of constraints, their
formalization and how the industry professionalized over time.
Then, we continue by introducing our research ground and the specificity
of Zodiac Aerospace and how relevant it is for our research questions
(p.). The organization structure of this conglomerate of SMEs and
history of acquisitions is described in order to provide enough context
for the reader to grasp engineering and marketing challenges.
Finally, we will briefly present the selected cases (section

<h1 id="aviation-industry-market-secpresentation_market">Aviation industry market [sec:presentation_market]</h1>
<p>The aviation industry started off with many successful and failed
attempts since the eighteenth century. It is only after the 19th century
industrial revolutions that investors and influencers started promoting
the development air balloons, Zeppelins and gliders along with
engine-powered aircrafts.
In this section, we develop the establishment and evolution of this
market, the challenges associated with product development, its
perspectives, and the position of a large equipment manufacturer such as
Zodiac Aerospace.
Sources used for this section range for courses taken by the researcher
during his studies in aeronautical engineering (ISAE-SUPAERO), the
Museum of Conservatoire National des Arts-et-Métiers, public domain

and internal documentation provided by the communication office of
Zodiac Aerospace.</p>

<h3 id="pioneering-establishment-and-consolidation">Pioneering, establishment and consolidation</h3>
<p>It is usually recognized that the first flight of a fixed-wing
powered-aircraft was the <em>Éole</em> in 1890, developed by Clément Ader with
the support of the Péreire family - who had previously financed part of
Hausman’s renovation. His works were an application of discoveries and
theoretical models formulated earlier in the century by George Cayley
(first fixed-wing glider and formulation of drag and lift forces and the
usefulness of cambered wings<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>).</p>
<p>The French Military Ministry had gained interest in his engineering
efforts who encouraged further experimentation with the support of the
ministry’s engineering departments, a council of professors and the
establishment of a school of &ldquo;<em>aircraftery</em>&quot;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
The subsequent developments led to <em>Avion II</em> and <em>Avion III</em> (see
Fig.<a href="#fig:AderAvion3" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:AderAvion3">1</a>),
the army had plans for observation and bombing. Several experiments were
conducted to master the aircraft. However, with the crash of <em>Avion
III</em>, the difficulties to explain what lessons could be drawn, and the
secrecy imposed by the Army, left C.Ader without any further financial
support to continue the trial-and-error process started. As explained by
himself in his book (Ader 
<a href="#ref-Ader1907">1907</a>), he may have started
too early and it would have been preferable to work publicly. It then
abandoned the legacy of the <em>Éole</em> and his larger project of
contributing to the National Defence through the founding of a school
for aviation.</p>
<figure>
<img src="AderAvion3.jpg" id="fig:AderAvion3" style="width:80.0%" alt="" /><figcaption>Clement Ader’s <em>Avion III</em> in 1897</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Clément Ader’s project would be fulfilled later by Colonel Jean-Baptiste
Roche when creating the Superior School of Aeronautics and Mechanical
Construction in 1909, now known under the name of ISAE-SUPAERO
(Toulouse)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. But another trend had gained more visibility in parallel
to development attempts of rotating/fixed-wing aircrafts: hot air
balloons had been developed starting in 1784 with the <em>Intrépide</em> flying
over the Versailles castle with Montgolfier brothers<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.
Several &ldquo;research companies&rdquo; (<em>Société d’Études</em>) were established to
develop airships with the support of investors (a key venture capitalist
at that time was Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe), politicians, and
academics from different institutions (Aéro-club de France, Science
Academy, Engineering Schools such as Mines ParisTech, Ecole
Polytechnique and St Cyr). For example, here are a few key names: Grands
Ateliers Aérostatiques du Champ-de-Mars by E.Surcouf in 1880, later
renamed Société Astra who would manufacture Wright brothers’ aircraft
under licence and Société &ldquo;Mallet, Mélandri et de Pitray&rdquo; in 1896 (later
named Zodiac in 1911)<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. They had an industrial vision for these
applications that were the hype in that time in World Exhibitions. Along
with air races and numerous experiments, applications for the Army and
Transportation were also targeted as use cases. They had been validated
for instance during the American Civil War with the Union Army Balloon
Corps<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="zodiac1900.jpg" id="fig:zodiac1900" style="width:80.0%" alt="" /><figcaption>Exposition Universelle "Zodiac" airship in 1909</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Besides airships, technology transfers and alternative approaches where
developed during the same period such as the effort of Alberto
Santos-Dumont with the famous 14bis (1906) and Demoiselle (1907)
fixed-wing aircrafts, Henry Fabre (first seaplane in 1910) and Coanda’s
first alleged jet engines (ducted air fan with combustion chamber in
1910), <em>Appareils d’Aviation Les Frères Voisin</em> (est. 1906, later split
and integrated into what would become <em>Gnome&amp;Rhône</em> est. 1905, i.e.
SNECMA/Safran Aircraft Engines) and <em>Blériot Aéronautique</em>, a
constituent of today’s Airbus along with former Dassault Aviation
(<em>Société des Avions Marcel Bloch</em>, est. 1929) who had merged with
pioneering work of <em>Bréguet Aviation</em> (est. 1911).
Of course, the list is not exhaustive, but we would like to stress the
numerous links tied by inventors and investors across several decades of
experiments, partnerships and industrial settings. And similar stories
could also be presented in other countries of Europe and North
America.
The frenzy was also channelled by the founding of companies such as
<em>Compagnie générale transaérienne</em> (est.1908 by Blériot) <em>Compagnie des
Messagers Aériens</em> (founded in 1919 by Bréguet, Blériot, Renault and
Caudron) and <em>Compagnie Générale Aéropostale</em> (est. 1918, by
Pierre-Georges Latécoère) who created a market to sustain an emerging
industry besides military applications. The former would then be
acquired by growing competition, mergers to become Air France for
instance.
The premises of the aviation industry was a collective effort of
engineering where a dominant design was gradually established discarding
airships for reliability issues. Different architectures with engines
moving from the back (pusher) to the front of the fuselage (tractor),
different profiles for lift and drag trade-offs (&ldquo;canard configuration&rdquo;,
box-kite) and steering/stability equipment (box-kite, dihedral, rudders,
ailerons), fixed wheels or idlers, etc.</p>
<p>The value of the &ldquo;<em>aircraftery</em>&rdquo; took decades to be demonstrated with
trials made by a community of pioneers who thrived from building in
parallel an ecosystem and organizations supporting their product
designs: Army, influential investors, mutual investments and self
investment in the creation of market (e.g. mailing and transportation),
academic institution creation, learned societies, associations and
federations. This is a crucial aspect to emphasize as the setting of the
market was not a linear process, nor the lonely process of several
pioneers who demonstrated the superiority of product design.</p>
<h3 id="a-turning-point-jet-age">A turning point: jet age</h3>
<p>Following major improvements made during and after World War I (WWI),
the jet era would finally come to existence despite first tentative
steps made by Henri-Marie Coanda in 1910. The latter being marginalized
during the second exhibition of the International Aeronautic Salon in
October 1910 against standard designs and persisting
doubts/controversies on the actual airworthiness of the aircraft and the
engine (ducted air fan or actual jet engine). The figures below show the
Coanda-1910
(<a href="#sub:Coanda1910" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sub:Coanda1910">[sub:Coanda1910]</a>)
versus the two dominant designs of that time: airships and unshrouded
propellers aircrafts
(<a href="#sub:Salon1909" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sub:Salon1909">[sub:Salon1909]</a>
and
<a href="#sub:Salon1910" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sub:Salon1910">[sub:Salon1910]</a>).</p>
<p>I0.5</p>
<p>As several records would be broken by aviators (distance, time and
speed), aircraft designers and manufacturers would also compete in
engineering novel engines, optimising propellers, materials, in addition
to wing and fuselage designs. For instance, one can recall the success
of <em>Blériot XI</em> when crossing the English Channel against Antoinette
aircraft, encouraging its promotion during the 1st Paris Air show (see
Fig.
<a href="#sub:Salon1909" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sub:Salon1909">[sub:Salon1909]</a>).</p>
<p>Conceptual models and theoretical efforts were made by physicists and
engineers building upon the earlier works of George Cayley in the 19th
century. Besides the need for pilot training such as rudimentary
&ldquo;<em>tonneau Antoinette</em>&quot;, wind tunnels were built to formalize design
parameters in addition to testing facilities sponsored by the army. For
example, Gustave Eiffel wind tunnels built in 1909 in Paris (Champ de
Mars) (Gallant 
<a href="#ref-Gallant2002">2002</a>; Barr 
<a href="#ref-Barr1992">1992</a>)
contributed not only to mechanical engineering for buildings but also to
aerodynamics.</p>
<p>Air Transportation would only start to exist with several routes of
airships in North America and Europe, but with WWI bombers converted for
passengers, the first airlines were created and dedicated aircraft
designs such as the Farman Goliath F60 derived from the F50 bomber (see
Fig.
<a href="#fig:GoliathF60a" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:GoliathF60a">3</a>).
With increasing speeds, optimization of turbo-propellers, sonic speeds
can be reached at the propellers tips, so shrouded configurations can be
beneficial encouraging the development of ducted-fan and then turbofan,
a kind of jet engine.</p>
<p>Advancements in jet engines became a major architectural innovation for
heavier-than-air aircrafts (Henderson and Clark

<a href="#ref-Henderson1990">1990</a>). It sets a milestone in the development of
long haul flights and commercial aviation. It would be hard to say that
it was unexpected for established industrial players. However, it raises
the issue of perception and cognition of change in product design
(incremental, radical, architectural and modular) and the ecosystem
deals with the emergence of this shifts.
The onset of the jet era occurred with the commercial aviation
intensification, flight routes tailored supporting a wider phenomenon
usually dubbed &ldquo;globalization&rdquo;. Distances are shortened, leisure is
democratized for wider categories of population, with major emphasis put
on the efficiency of engines for airlines operations.
The frequency and variety of aircraft missions across the globe also
raised numerous evolutions for safety and robustness. Redundancy is the
baseline for most aircraft systems (operational). Several other
architectural innovations can be listed in the evolution such as the
elimination of the Flight Engineer in the cockpit as a side-effect of
development of electronics and digital commands.</p>

<h2 id="market-order-and-segmentation">Market order and segmentation</h2>
<h3 id="major-players-and-market-organization">Major players and market organization</h3>
<p>The market is mainly organized by aircraft manufacturers who integrate
the systems and equipment (co-)designed by suppliers. It is hardly
impossible to avoid the prescription mechanisms associated to Boeing and
Airbus, and marginally by Bombardier, Embraer and increasingly Irkut and
Comac. Several mergers of engineering services and manufacturers
consolidated what Boeing and Airbus are today. For instance, Boeing
absorbed McDonnell Douglas, Airbus is the result of the merger of Sud
Aviation and Nord Aviation to become first Aérospatiale. Forces were
joined, redistributing the roles of among historic roles: airframers,
structural part engineering and aircraft integration.
Overall, the market can be seen as an oligopoly for systems and
equipment manufacturers. The whole being layered to meet the integration
requirements of the aircraft manufacturer. See Fig.
<a href="#fig:MarketOrg" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:MarketOrg">4</a>
for further details.</p>
<figure>
<img src="MarketOrg.png" id="fig:MarketOrg" style="width:80.0%" alt="" /><figcaption>Schematics of market organization</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After numerous series of mergers and acquisitions at all market levels,
the number of players has reduced drastically. This consolidation has
put a certain order and hierarchy in market relationships, encouraging
players to by-pass some players to gain insight.</p>
<p>One can refer for instance to the mapping built by Grundman Advisory
from 1993 to 2016. A few more can be added such as Safran acquiring
Zodiac Aerospace and United Technologies Corporation (UTC) with Rockwell
Collins (who recently acquired B/E Aerospace). The very large mapping
(pdf format) can be accessed on Grundman’s Advisory news section:
<em>Aviation Week publishes Grundman Opinion, &ldquo;A map of aerospace mergers
and acquisitions&rdquo;</em><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Given this context, airlines undergoing changes in demographics,
population displacement, market design (e.g. hub structure) have
evolving requirements for aircraft missions: longer routes, multiple
stopovers across a continent, low maintenance etc. The aircraft
manufactures perform a preliminary proposal to meet their key customers
(major airlines).
Aircrafts can be categorized in now three groups: short/long haul, and
currently business magazines tend to introduce the concept of
&ldquo;middle-of-market&rdquo;. Below, Fig.
<a href="#fig:AircraftMarketSegments" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:AircraftMarketSegments">5</a>
shows along two <em>performance criteria</em> the three sets of aircrafts.
Despite visual and alleged similarities between short/long haul
aircrafts, physics, design rules and systems’ architectures do not allow
a simple rule of three. Aircraft programs are spanned across roughly a
decade in average (from the early designs to first delivery) mobilizing
several suppliers in a co-development process and requirements cascaded
down along the hierarchy of product/service design.</p>
<figure>
<img src="AircraftMarketSegments.jpg" id="fig:AircraftMarketSegments" style="width:80.0%" alt="" /><figcaption>Aircraft Market Segments</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Among suppliers, as most players are conglomerate of SMEs, these follow
in broad strokes the perimeters given by the ATA chapters (Air
Transportation Association). The classification is originally intended
for engineers and technicians performing repairs and maintenance duties
on aircrafts. Aircraft systems are covered from ATA no.20 to 92. For
example, ATA 44 corresponds to Cabin Systems, where one can find the
following sub-systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>44-00 General</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>44-10 Cabin Core System</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>44-20 In-flight Entertainment System</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>44-30 External Communication System</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>44-40 Cabin Mass Memory System</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>44-50 Cabin Monitoring System</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>44-60 Miscellaneous Cabin System</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As one can see, it does not cover for instance several &ldquo;monuments&rdquo; found
in the cabin: seats, class dividers, lavatories, galleys, etc. ATA
follows a system architecture description and the cabin domain should be
seen as an area sanctuarised by airline for customization and branding.
Naturally, it has more players specialized equipment certified by
Technical Standard Order (TSO, see below for further details).</p>
<h3 id="importance-of-safety-and-regulations">Importance of safety and regulations</h3>
<p>First safety regulation can be associated with a publication of the
Paris Police headquarters dating from April 23, 1784. It followed the
flight of the hot air balloon built by the Montgolfier brothers in late
1783 for King Louis XVI at Versailles castle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It shall be unlawful to manufacture and lift off balloons and other
aerostatic machines with heaters using wine spirit, fire crackers and
other flammable materials and orders that all other aerostatic
balloons may not take-off without permission. Such permission shall
only be granted to people with recognized experience and
capability&hellip;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the early delays, the approach to aircraft safety came as insurance
for justifying on one hand what objects were safe and reliable according
to a set of standardized criteria and on the other hand the how and the
who required to design, develop and sustain these objects.</p>
<p>Despite some differences between the rules established for North America
and Europe - Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Aviation
Safety Agency (EASA) respectively - they ensure airworthiness<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> along
four main domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Monitoring Safety issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Product Certified &amp; Checked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safety Rules &amp; regulations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approved Organizations</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These topics are declined in the certification process that is
recognized with the issue of Type Certificate for the aircraft and
associated scope covering critical systems and equipment (e.g.
electrical power generation and distribution). In addition, almost
standalone equipment such as engine have their own Type Certificate and
&ldquo;<em>less critical</em>&quot;<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> equipment with Technical Standard Order (TSO); so
they can be qualified and certified with a relative independence from
the aircraft manufacturer.
The general process is described in the Fig.
<a href="#fig:CertificationProcess" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:CertificationProcess">6</a>
pictures the phases until the release of a form (e.g. EASA Form-1/FAA
8130-3) validating the conformity of the manufactured/repaired product
given an extensive list of justification documents issued by Design,
Manufacturing and Maintenance activities. The figure also insists on the
fact that airworthiness is maintained throughout the life of the
product, meaning until it is dismantled and removed from the aircraft
fleet.</p>
<figure>
<img src="CertificationProcess.jpg" id="fig:CertificationProcess" style="width:80.0%" alt="" /><figcaption>Certification Process</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The certification and crucial airworthiness aspect, a more technical set
of requirements are addressed by
system/equipment/technology/material-specific standards. These are
issued by several regulatory bodies such as SAE International (Society
of Automotive Engineers) issuing Aerospace Recommended Practice (ARP),
EUROCAE (European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment), RTCA
(Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics) issuing standards for
instance &ldquo;Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne
Equipment&rdquo;, MIL-STD from the US Military Standard, etc. Qualification
and design processes requirements are largely compliant with these
standards in addition to customer requirements.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) has greatly contributed to the standardization of processes with
ISO9100 / AS9100 (Aerospace Basic Quality System Standard).</p>
<h2 id="challenges-and-future-changes">Challenges and future changes</h2>
<p>The market is rapidly growing based on surveys and forecasts made by
Boeing and Airbus on yearly basis. Asia-Pacific countries are greatly
contributing to this trend with legacy aircrafts being retrofitted in
major American and European countries despite several external shocks.</p>
<figure>
<img src="TrafficGrowth.jpg" id="fig:TrafficGrowth" style="width:80.0%" alt="" /><figcaption>World Annual traffic evolution - Airbus Global Market Forecast 2017</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>35000 aircrafts will be delivered by 2036, among which 13000 are for
replacement and the rest being actual new deliveries growth. Traffic
will keep on increasing with rate per annum from 2.5% between advanced
countries up to 6.2% between emergent countries taking most of the
traffic share (40%). Finally, several other trends can be foreseen with
environmental considerations, passengers demographics and changing urban
mobility.</p>
<h3 id="greener-aircrafts">Greener aircrafts</h3>
<p>The rising awareness of human’s activity on Earth has also encouraged
the aviation industry to develop means of reducing its greenhouse effect
share. For instance, from the viewpoint of fuel combustion, optimizing
engines with a criteria such as number of passengers per kilometre per
litre of kerosene in addition to emitted $CO_2$ and $NOx$ particles per
number of passengers per kilometre. Tremendous engineering efforts were
made to enhance the efficiency of the combustion chambers, engine
sections (fan, compressor and turbines) and overall architecture
(by-pass). These efforts are still on going with open-rotor engine.
Taxiing of aircrafts could also be changed to avoid burning fuel with
electrical drive in landing gears or pushback car integrated on taxiing
rails.
Other architectures such as delta wing for commercial aircrafts and
V-formation flight (inspired by geese flying patterns) have been
imagined by industrial actors. These approaches also tend to think the
overall aircraft and its integration within the airspace and airports.
Incremental innovations however can be designed by using lighter
materials while guaranteeing strength. For instance, marginal
improvements on wingtips or using composite materials for the skin of
wings and fuselage reduce overall weight. Nevertheless, these
replacement are not modular as it dramatically reduces the
electromagnetic shielding required against thunderstorms or simple
electromagnetic interferences. Shielding should then be improved across
wirings and harnesses needed for fly-by-wire systems<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> and several
other electricity powered devices.
A greener aircraft does not only imply optimization along several
green-performance-indicators exploiting the dominant design, nor
replacing some features, but also has a greater impact on the
architecture of the aircraft itself and sensitivity to the evolutions of
the aircraft integration (e.g. airport, air traffic patterns, flight
route demands, etc.)</p>
<h3 id="passenger-demographics-and-trends">Passenger demographics and trends</h3>
<p>Passengers through airlines interaction the evolution of the market.
Passengers are more and more observed and consulted by airlines,
aircraft manufacturers and equipment manufacturers. Beyond traditional
satisfaction survey, creativity sessions and ethnographic observations
in &ldquo;labs&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.
Currently, the expectation of passengers are changing. Let us take, for
instance, the evolution of seats in the cabin. Historically, no
distinction existed. Then with the gradual democratization, class
segments were created: first, club and economy. The club disappeared to
be replaced by the idea of a business class, with now sometimes dense
business class, reducing the size of the first that aims for a
hotel-like experience. These nuances should also be declined depending
on culture and flight routes across the globe.
Ageing population is another concern for cabin layout including: seating
and lavatories. Reduced mobility of certain categories of passengers
also causes several issues for seating, movement along corridors and
reaching for different cabin areas. Seats architecture and access are
modified, additional equipment to assist are also designed.
So called <em>millenials</em> emphasize the rising ubiquity of (Internet)
connectivity on mainland and ground transportation. Airlines have been
gradually shaping the business model of connectivity with new suppliers
and services providers offering solutions guaranteeing an almost
continuous connectivity. From traditional shared displays hanging over
seats, to seat-centric inflight-entertainment, the passengers are now
also willing to connect to existing solutions: in-flight connectivity
(Wi-Fi and entertainment server) supported by antennae and ground/space
relays, and active/passive displays for mirror casting personal device
content or accessing airline provided content.
These novelties being transferred from an evolving society and use cases
where aircraft experience may appear old fashioned. They bring numerous
uncertainties to a professionalized and highly constrained engineering.
New product development may then fit the given architecture but may also
encourage the generation of ad-hoc solutions and reconfiguration of
(epistemic) interdependencies.</p>
<h3 id="urban-mobility">Urban mobility</h3>
<p>Finally, another major trend is the regain in urban mobility. The
reducing flight times and connecting time at stopovers, has dramatically
reduced distances across the globe. Combining this trend with city
expansion, road and general public transportation can become saturated
to point where other means must be developed. In cities of high
inequalities such as Sao Paulo, helicopters are an efficient alternative
to travel across the city avoid traffic jams for those who can afford.
Social imaginaries tend to contribute to urban mobility effort on
adapting aircraft to fly safely through the city skies. Science fiction
works in literature and movies have embodied these ideas for more than a
century.</p>
<p>However, it is gradually becoming a reality with Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle’s technologies developed in the past two decades. Automation,
algorithmic robustness, and mastering of flight dynamics for quadcopter
designs for instance were key in addressing the scaling of remote
control devices to civil/military applications, and up to autonomous
taxi.
In the last 5 years, several initiatives, usually referred as Passenger
Drones, were launched. In China, <em>eHang 184</em> flew early 2018, in
Germany, <em>Lilium</em> is being developed, in Dubai and Germany the
<em>Volocopter</em> was developed and test flights were conducted, Airbus has
two concepts developed in two different centres: a traditional
vertical-take-off and landing (VTOL) called <em>Vahana</em>, and a modular
solution combined with car <em>Pop.Up</em>. These passenger drones enable
on-demand air transportation expanding the horizons of taxi fleets and
personal/public transportation with safer means of flight travel that
are not reachable with traditional light aviation airworthiness.
The evolution of the market order and segmentation given the highlighted
trends encourage equipment manufacturers to carefully reconsider the way
products and services are developed. In the following section, we
develop how projects and programs are managed given the aviation history
depicted previously. Its professionalization has established rules,
processes and structures to support new product development which we
will address at the light of several novelties, increasing uncertainties
and the need to innovate, i.e. managing the unknown.</p>
<h1 id="zodiac-aerospace-innovation-context-secrelevance">Zodiac Aerospace Innovation Context [sec:relevance]</h1>
<p>In this section, we propose to present the context of the research
project offered by Zodiac Aerospace. We cover its overall organization,
its history, examples of major innovations in the aviation industry and
how R&amp;T and Innovation are managed across the group of SMEs.</p>
<h2 id="general-organization-conglomerate-of-smes">General organization: conglomerate of SMEs</h2>
<p>The thesis was conducted at the Technical &amp; Innovation Direction of
Zodiac Aerospace (ZSA, holding). Established in 1896 by Maurice Mallet,
the venture initially targeted airship and fabric engineering. It has
now turned into a large industrial group of 75 entities designing,
developing and manufacturing aeronautical equipment for
aircraft/helicopters manufacturer and airlines. These are located over
100 facilities across the globe and mainly centralized in Europe and
North America. In the last couple of decades, some facilities were
established in cost-competitive countries for the serial production of
some entities.
The group of SMEs where each of them, with a few hundreds employees
each, equating to a total of 35,000, have their own responsibility and
performance logic. A light group holding of 200 employees with several
support functions have the challenge to manage the sometimes competing
SMEs due to the market structures and build up synergies targeted by the
executive committee. As shown in the following page, we present the
variety of Zodiac Aerospace products that can be found on an aircraft.
The segmentation by branches dates from 2015, but the current status is
a merge between Cabin &amp; Structures and Galleys &amp; Equipment (now called
Zodiac Cabin), and Aircraft Systems and Aerosafety (now called Zodiac
Aerosystems). Most equipment is represented by a single business unit,
overlap is rare between entities. For example, in the kitchen area
(galley) the configuration is the following with all separate
engineering departments, standards and regulations and sales channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The galley structure (frame, panels and fixtures) is developed by
Zodiac Galleys Europe/US</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The inserts (oven, boilers, coffee makers, bun warmers and ice
containers) are developed by Zodiac Electrical Inserts Europe/US</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trolleys designed by Zodiac Air Catering Equipment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lavatories are composed of the lining/decorative elements
(Zodiac Airline Interior Integration) and of toilet seat and
underlying water &amp; waste systems (Zodiac Water &amp; Waste Systems)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-history-of-complementary-niche-strategy">A history of complementary niche strategy</h2>
<p>Zodiac Aerospace, actually stems from the separation with Zodiac Marine.
The former Zodiac Group had been expanding between seas and skies with
technology transfers from air balloons to inflatable boat<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>, and
several other extensions playing on complementarities to expand its
footprint.</p>
<p>The history of mergers and acquisitions, leaving aside the former Zodiac
Marine group of entities, can be traced back to the seventies with EFA
(Parachutes in United States) reopening the aeronautics branch as shown
in the figure below (Fig.
<a href="#fig:acquisitions" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:acquisitions">8</a>).
The main drivers for acquisitions, as explained on Zodiac Aerospace
corporate presentation, are synthesized into five key principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Diversifying in businesses with a high technological content,
through internal and external growth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Favouring niche markets to rapidly attain leader positions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring steady growth in earnings per share</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supporting customers over the long-term through a strong after-sales
activity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aligning our operations with the Principles of the Global Compact</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first group of acquisitions intended to gain stronghold in the
aircraft safety systems market whilst still developing some related
marine activities around rubber coated fabrics (Kléber Industries),
flexible tanks (Superflexit), parachutes (EFA, Parachutes de France) and
arresting/evacuation systems (Air Cruisers, Aerazur). The family
shareholders’ trust put in the newly appointed CEO Jean-Louis Gérondeau.
He led an external growth strategy helping the financial recovery and
building a strong position in the aircraft equipment market. The
strategy was then extended with several other niche markets (mainly
oligopoly) with high added value justified by complex engineering
know-how complying with safety and airworthiness regulations. For
instance, early nineties was the entry into the aircraft seating (Weber
Aircraft, Sicma Aero Seat), water &amp; waste systems (Monogram/MAG Aero and
Avon) and oxygen devices as well as sensing and systems management
(Groupe Intertechnique).
Overall, we have more than 40 acquisitions since late seventies which
enabled diversification around the inflatable boat decaying market with
sport and leisure perspectives. But mostly, the group regained a
leadership position in the aircraft equipment market by federating
numerous SMEs.</p>
<p>As told by Olivier Zarrouati<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> during an open interview in May 2018
conducted by the PhD candidate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We scouted our environment for niches with high added value, after a
selection process, we would then make sure that new business unit will
be able to perform and hold its position in the market. When it comes
then to innovative concepts, the trick is really to make sure they
understand the value of novelty on their own and not by forcing it by
top management.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This mindset was also confirmed by a separate interview made with the
Vice President of the group, Maurice Pinault, former CEO of Zodiac
Marine activities.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="feats-of-engineering">Feats of engineering</h2>
<p>The history of Zodiac Aerospace has left several landmarks in the domain
of engineering. Starting the nascent airship venture, engineering
know-how was developed for fabric engineering and sewing techniques.
Then, when redeveloping the company in the aircraft market over less
than three decades, the group developed its competencies in complex
engineering for aircraft systems, and material and stress engineering
for cabin equipment.</p>
<h3 id="technical-fabric-and-associated-technologies">Technical fabric and associated technologies</h3>
<p>The airship industry at the wake of the $20^{th}$ century required not
only building an understanding of models of flight mechanics but being
able to design, engineering and manufacture robust fabric assemblies.
Standards of quality or test engineering were being gradually
established. Tensile strength of a piece of a fabric was crucial but
sewing techniques was an even more critical feature of these assemblies.
Advanced Sewing techniques were required for overall resistance to
aerodynamic forces (lift and drag) and associated designs.
With growing competition in an established market of inflatable boat,
Zodiac Aerospace managed to expand these competencies with the parachute
industry, inflatable boats, airbags, emergency evacuation systems
(slides, life rafts) and arresting systems (nets and harnesses on
runways). Several of these high skilled work can also be observed in
weaving and braiding techniques for conduits and hoses for harsh
environments. The developed industry thus greatly differs from clothing
industry with safety and airworthiness standards that imply a wide
spectrum of physical variables (temperature, tensile in static/dynamic
modes). It has greatly contributed to the unique position in a
quasi-duopoly with strong commercial and technical bonds with aircraft
manufacturers (Airbus, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas).
Zodiac Aerospace has dominated the market of Parachutes, aircraft
arresting and evacuation systems and also part of the market associated
with braided/woven products. Unique technologies were developed to
remain competitive in several areas: flexible fuel tanks, open sleeves
for electrical harnesses and net arresting systems.</p>
<h3 id="composites-materials-and-cabin-equipment">Composites materials and cabin equipment</h3>
<p>Early nineties, the Zodiac group had been developing the leisure and
sport marine domain to expand the inflatable boat market (Zodiac, Avon
and Bombard product lines). Their entry into the aircraft seating market
was done through Weber company who also had several engineering and
manufacturing capabilities in aircraft parts and synergies with its
former conglomerate Walter Kidde and Company Inc who had sold the
business to a largely diversified British conglomerate (Hanson
PLC).<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> Kidde had also a foot in the inflatable boat market during
the war effort. A similar move was operated with SICMA in France, which
had been developing aircraft structural part, seats and also skis and
tennis rackets.
Engineering could be then developed in the domain of material
engineering. Structural parts for pilot, crew and passenger seating were
developed and kept leadership by meeting and developing further safety
and certification requirements with authorities. The rest of the cabin
would then require similar technical capabilities for stress and
flammability constraints.
All cabin interiors and galley’s area require qualification and
certification competencies to package for instance kitchen appliances to
airworthiness standards. All of which also requires to withstand severe
static and dynamic mechanical testing which are complex to monitor and
use for further design of assemblies and parts. Furthermore,
standardization is not common in this market because of market volumes
and changing demand of airlines looking for unique branding
opportunities.</p>
<h3 id="aircraft-systems">Aircraft systems</h3>
<p>At the end of the $20^{th}$ century, the group continued to settle its
position in other fields of the aircraft equipment market. Monogram (MAG
Aerospace) and Groupe Intertechnique were acquired. They had
respectively developed themselves in the field of water &amp; waste systems
engineering and embedded systems for aircraft operations (computer,
printed circuit boards, fuel gauging systems, oxygen masks and control
systems). These two first acquisitions were a key advantage to secure
market niches. Added value is accomplished through complex system
engineering, functional robustness and secured certification
capabilities for further product development. It was the occasion to
combine engineering competencies into the creation of a business unit in
the field of airbags for automotive industry with inflatable technical
fabric and precise control electronic systems.
Later, these activities would be complemented by several power
electronics generation and distribution (ECE, Zodiac Electrical Power
Systems), wiring parts/systems and hydraulic, servo-control and ducting
systems. The underlying SMEs acquired on such domains had been building
their field first through components and quickly grew into engineering
of sub-systems and full systems in order to cover regulation and
certification domain. Several breakthroughs can be mentioned such as
inerting systems for fuel tanks, oxygen regulators, or even metal
fabrication in harsh environments.</p>
<h2 id="todays-rt-and-innovation-an-oddity-for-innovation-management">Today’s R&amp;T and Innovation: an oddity for innovation management?</h2>
<h3 id="zstc-and-experts-network">ZSTC and Experts Network</h3>
<p>Established in 2010 by the managing director of former Intertechnique
group (covering former Aerotechnique group of activities, i.e. Fuel &amp;
Control Systems and Oxygen Systems), the Zodiac Scientific and Technical
Council (ZSTC) gathers engineering managers and R&amp;T managers equally
representing the variety of activities in the group. It was created for
four main objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prepare technological evolution for the decade ahead and reinforce
synergies: long-term Technology Road Map were created to fit market
&amp; sales perspectives to feed product lines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Value technical experts across the company: expert career path
created with Human Resources for engineers preferring a technical
career instead of one dedicated to management<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reinforce relationships with academia, start-ups, innovative
suppliers and potential partners: incentives to host PhD candidates
in R&amp;T departments, collaborative research programs, <em>TechnoDays</em>
seminars to gather people around common topics (e.g. composite
materials, electronics, systems engineering, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reinforce Intellectual Property protection and management, as well
as R&amp;T management practice (guidelines and procedures)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The council creation was supported by the Vice President of the group
(Maurice Pinault) for its strategic leverage:</p>
<p><em>It is a major leverage of growth for the Group such ours which designs
and manufacturers the most complex systems and that is required to meet
regulation constraints and quality &amp; safety requirements increasingly
harder. In 2010, we created the ZSTC to improve the performance of our
technological research, to gather necessary resources for our
competitivity and foster the development of cross-cutting innovation
with high added value.</em><sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p>
<p>The joint effort contributed to encourage transversality through some
major disciplines for the group such as material flammability, power
electronics, systems engineering and composite material engineering and
manufacturing. <em>TechnoDays</em> have been organized for these topics,
experts were nominated locally in business units, and through round of
interviews experts gain different status degrees of the career path:</p>

</figure>
<h3 id="late-creation-of-rt-function-through-trl-assessment">Late Creation of R&amp;T function through TRL assessment</h3>
<p>Given this initial background and internal efforts made in the business
units Zodiac Fuel &amp; Control Systems to constitute a dedicated R&amp;T Team
(in 2012-2013), workshops were organized with the support of a
consultancy firm to define and implement technology road maps (TRMs) for
all business units. With a bottom-up approach validated by top
management strategy, road maps were fed with marketing and sales data
picturing the future markets and technologies were identified to enable
and facilitate potential market access. Aircraft and equipment
manufacturers had been implementing the notion of Technology Readiness
Level (TRL) which streamlined the road-mapping.
Guidelines were subsequently written to support the rollout of this new
language and practice. Business units were then able to provide and use
a maturity assessment canvas for the technologies in development and the
road ahead for integration. The president of the ZSTC was then appointed
Chief Technical Officer (CTO) of the Zodiac Aerospace group, a new
position created by the CEO. His role consisted in gradually
institutionalizing the R&amp;T function in business units, supporting them
for public funding opportunities and auditing the practice of R&amp;T and
innovation management (TRL assessment, TRM, patent application and PhD
subjects).</p>
<h2 id="an-innovation-locus-where-exploration-project-management-and-organizational-design-clash">An innovation locus where exploration project management and organizational design clash</h2>
<p>So far, we have portrayed in the previous pages the history of aircraft
engineering, the establishment of design rules and the acquisitions
strategy of Zodiac Aerospace. Several key features can be listed
characterizing the innovation context for Zodiac Aerospace (see below).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An industrial ecosystem at stake with increasing uncertainties and
unknown due to strong segregated rigidities mirrored by engineering,
safety and regulations but facing potential radical transformations
of architecture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complexity and difficulty to master a full system (architecture and
components) - myopic behaviours</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Architectures defined in a contingent manner by the ecosystem
raising uncertainties and the unknown shifts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Urge to innovate for strategic competitive advantage in the wake of
a radical change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A consolidated market made of conglomerate but without being
traditional divisional firms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Autonomy and responsibility of individual SMEs but the necessity to
orchestrate their interdependencies to innovate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projects situated in a intra-BU and inter-BU context challenging
product/service design and organizations simultaneously</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A light corporate team dedicated to innovation with several relay
networks (professions, experts)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Zodiac Aerospace presents a distributed innovation management with an
ongoing standardization for processes (Quality Management System) and to
some extent structures (R&amp;T department separated from Development
Engineering). Each BU has its own responsibility and dedicated financial
reporting. They all face their own market segment with the associated
professionalisation but also the urge to embrace uncertainties and the
unknown to innovate.</p>
<p>This situation encourages to understand the place in the (aircraft)
system architecture, the interfaces, the interdependencies and knowledge
yet to be discovered to guide exploration and consider synergies with
other BUs. It is a concern for top management as they worry about the
strategy of this portfolio of SMEs.</p>
<p>The CEO and VP<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> have stressed the idea the intent was to secure the
niches in the long run, but still develop their own capabilities to
prepare the future. They specified the importance of branch directors to
oversee the portfolio of business units to build a sustainable strategy
for them. Top management had for instance launched several initiatives
they considered to be key for the group or gave a place for bottom-up
projects.</p>
<p>For example, transversality was gradually being organized with
communities of experts, TechnoDays, (in)formal communities of practice
for engineering and R&amp;T managers at the BU or division level.
Top management also decided to launch projects and places were novel
products and services could be developed <em>in-between</em> the organizational
boundaries or just seen as strategic for the whole group. A fuel-cell
project was launched, hosted by a business unit with the prospect to
developing this technology for the aircraft equipment market with
perspectives on electricity, water and heat management. Two teams were
set near aircraft manufactures: one near Airbus and the other by Boeing.
These teams were composed of several engineers, designers and managers
from different business units. They dedicated 50% of their time to
technical support for their BU of origin; the rest was dedicated to
business intelligence and innovation management. Workshops, prototyping,
and presentations were regularly organized by the team to generate
concepts sometimes in partnership with clients, users and also
representatives of BUs.
The gradual rationalization of the R&amp;T and Innovation activities since
2010 with the establishment of R&amp;T and Innovation management within each
BU was supplemented by an effort coordinated by top management to the
develop even more radical design of products and services. The former
tend to address incremental innovation, sometimes radical ones aimed
through a path punctuated by several steps to test their environment.
For instance, long term projects are part of partnership agreement
funded by institutions such as associative, national or international
Research Councils. The latter were a means for the Executive Committee
to protect existing niches from more radical concepts.</p>
<p>In these specific case raising strategic interest, such project were
addressed in a different <em>locus</em> breaking away from the existing and
protected organization design: the multi-BU committee was rather
convenient. Otherwise, the Business Unit being is considered as an
indivisible unit. It encourages the development of alternative
approaches: fostering exploration topics, steering committees for
valuation and strategy, and project management.</p>
<h1 id="case-studies-selection-seccase_selection">Case studies selection [sec:case_selection]</h1>
<h2 id="brief-case-description-seccases">Brief case description [sec:cases]</h2>
<p>Below, we present the different case studies conducted at Zodiac
Aerospace and that where discussed in five different articles in
Appendix. Due to organizational dimension of innovation management of
this conglomerate of SMEs, and the organization design, we propose to
split the cases in two categories: intra-BU and inter-BU. The trajectory
of studied projects were, in fact, more or less contained within the
perimeter of a business unit, market segment,
qualification/certification requirements. Other cases were deliberately
set in between these boundaries or across with top management
sponsorship.</p>
<h3 id="intra-bu-cases">Intra-BU cases</h3>
<h4 id="icing-conditions-detection-caseicing">Icing conditions detection [caseIcing]</h4>
<p>The first impulse originated in the early 90s with the concern a former
CEO - Intertechnique group (now Zodiac Fuel and Control Systems) - and
with the crash of an ATR72 in the U.S.A due to ice accretion on wings. A
project manager and engineer (who would eventually become the R&amp;T
manager), developed an ultrasonic sensor for wing’s skin to detect ice
and measure icing-protection fluid dilution ratio. It allowed
participating to several test campaigns, to gain a reputation in the
field for safety and airworthiness (DGAC, EASA, Transport Canada), and
develop two versions of the technology with the support of funding
(SPAé, European Power Optimized Aircraft) and synergies with pending
product development (e.g. computer electronics for A380). A first patent
was applied.</p>
<p>Early 2000s, the technology is compared in test campaigns with the
monopoly’s solution (Goodrich, former Richmond; mechanical oscillator).
It proved its efficiency on the ground but not for flying conditions due
to several technical limitations compared to competition’s: no defrost,
complex wing installation and high costs. Furthermore, Airbus did not
support the development as their aircraft (A380) is not sensitive to
icing. Airworthiness institutions were indeed specifying icing
conditions types and aircraft sensitivity.</p>
<p>However, regional aircraft manufacturers such as ATR and Bombardier were
pushing former Aerazur entity (now Zodiac Elastomer Europe) and
Intertechnique for an integrated ice detection and ice protection
system. With the support of several engineers recruited in previous
years, they developed a solution tested again with the support of Airbus
as the icing conditions detection regulations were evolving. Three test
campaigns were conducted with convincing results from an alternative
technology (thermodynamics and Peltier effect) overcoming the previous
limitations.</p>
<p>Despite an aircraft program request for proposal and with uncertainty
and potential surprises in airworthiness evolutions, the recently
established icing conditions team at Intertechnique pivoted towards an
unfamiliar technology for the BU (laser optics). Parallel studies were
conducted, and the R&amp;T manager had participated to technology
evaluations with FAA and Transport Canada. In addition, strategy and
business development managers had considered potential acquisitions to
definitely break the monopoly.</p>
<p>Finally, in 2011 a new project on uncertain laser technology was
launched within a CleanSky program. And more recently, a second project
was launched, with CleanSky2, forking the technology concept developed
so far and extending the airworthiness validity domain.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The researcher came around this case with the support of the
CTO and R&amp;T manager who explicitly mentioned the need to specify the
nature of this projects at odds with other R&amp;T and Engineering
Departments activities and with BU management. The project was seen as
an unidentified object despite having legitimacy in the airworthiness,
safety fields and among aircraft manufacturer engineering departments.
The generative processes needed to be further specified to understand
the nuances of its innovation potential of attraction with respect to
the engineering department, knowledge and organization design.</p>
<h4 id="business-class-seat-platform-casebc">Business Class Seat platform [caseBC]</h4>
<p>This case is an outcome of a recurrent topic at Zodiac Seats France:
standardization and modularization of seat architecture to facilitate
product development. Indeed, airlines demand for seats change every 5-10
years, including cabin reconfiguration for seasonal passengers flows,
and they request a short development cycle of about 2 years, compared to
the 10 years (approx.) for an aircraft. However, the seat is absolutely
critical in passenger safety with severe qualification and certification
requirements in association with increasing demands for
airline/passenger customization and ergonomic design. Despite the
beneficial prospects of platform engineering for economy and business
class seats, the rhythm of product development and complexity in
conjunction with optimized resources hadn’t left many opportunities to
develop such project.</p>
<p>Separated from development engineers, a recently constituted R&amp;T
department was tasked to study the modularization of a business class
seat for easier packaging and certification. A large exploration
(patent, design options, architectures, technologies etc.) was
considered and selection of design concepts were made based on product
development criteria and support of several engineering, operations and
marketing stakeholders. Further stress simulation and testing was
required, but following the bid award from a demanding airline, the
subsequent design and development was driven by customer requirements
and its design studio.</p>
<p>Several difficulties were discovered late in the development raising
questions on the maturity of the design and certification requirements
such as increased difficulties associated with the joint qualification
of seat and shell and inclusion of airbags. Delays were unfortunately
accumulated with numerous quality problems due to technical compromises.</p>
<p>Despite the exploration quality, exploitation issues had to be dealt
with. The project trajectory that aimed at developing a business class
seat platform was compromised.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The research was introduced to such product development case
as he was supporting the R&amp;T department in formalizing the TRL
assessment and associated management. The Director of Engineering and
R&amp;T managers were intrigued and disturbed by the design choices and
integration issues, requesting a deeper understanding of the
coordination and collective action model, as well as how the innovation
potential of attraction of the platform was managed.</p>
<h4 id="hypoxia-protection---researchers-intervention-casehypoxia">Hypoxia protection - researcher’s intervention [caseHypoxia]</h4>
<p>The R&amp;T department was preparing mid-2017 a participation to CleanSky2
program with Airbus as a partner in order to propose new radical
solution to protect pilots from hypoxia. The need emerged from the
necessity (safety) requiring a pilot to wear the emergency oxygen mask
when alone in the cockpit. Such requirement is however hardly compatible
with the required comfort of extended use due to emergency design of the
mask (high levels of stress, smoke in the cabin, emergency manoeuvre)..</p>
<p>The team was originally constituted of R&amp;T engineers, and then after 6
months, they were stretched over the traditional engineering department
dedicated to product development leaving only one R&amp;T member. Numerous
brainstorming and design sessions with the support from an external
design studio contributed to a wide and in-depth exploration.</p>
<p>In parallel, an internal &ldquo;Open Innovation Challenge&rdquo; organized by the
ZSTC for which one of the two topics was improving ergonomics of the
oxygen crew mask. The researcher had then proposed a C-K mapping to
position and value the concepts proposed by ZA participants. In addition
to the acquaintance with the R&amp;T and Engineering manager for other
purposes, the researcher was requested to support the project team in
selecting concepts, and guiding them before the first proposal to the
CleanSky2 partners.</p>
<p>It was the occasion to work on the decision-making and the design of
alternatives and states of nature, as well as embedding the organization
design required to support the innovation effort expected in the
project. The dichotomy of exploration/exploitation could then be
revisited and nuanced within this project. It enabled the proposal of
novel ways to organize collective action within and around the
exploration project.</p>
<h3 id="inter-bu-cases">Inter-BU cases</h3>
<h4 id="airbus-development-team---design-thinking-cases-caseadt">Airbus Development Team - Design Thinking cases [caseADT]</h4>
<p>The ADT is sponsored and monitored by the C-suite for strategic
management purposes. The team was tasked to provide technical support
for several BUs and to generate concepts that would feed on unmet user
needs by gaining a better knowledge of real use cases of ZA products.
The team is constituted of 8 permanent engineers and designers delegated
by BUs for three years maximum, and dedicating half of their time to
their BU’s sales/technical support. They report to a local manager who
actively contributes to the team creative effort and facilitates
discussions with BUs. He reports to the group VP of Strategy and
Business Development as well as the Chief Technical Officer.</p>
<p>The Design Thinking (DT) methodology was chosen to promote the
user-centric approach, explore usage, share gathered knowledge, and
ideate for and with relevant BUs. ADT’s two project leaders were trained
to DT at Stanford’s d.school, and other members were trained in other
institutions. A design and creativity spirit was largely promoted by the
local manager as well as the members themselves. The projects phasing
completely covered DT’s enactment themes (Carlgren, Rauth, and Elmquist

<a href="#ref-Carlgren2016a">2016</a>).</p>
<p>Both cases addressed transverse topics where many BUs are concerned in
some way or are actively part of the value chain. The first topic dealt
with waste managed onboard aircrafts. The second topic tackled the
optimization of aircraft turn around time (i.e. between landing and
take-off). Several users and extreme users can be searched and studied
to build empathy and also the technical/market knowledge from the
different BUs is tightly interfaced around both topics.</p>
<p>In order to fit the scope of work of the ADT, the team shared knowledge
with BUs to keep them up-to-date and build legitimacy all along the DT
process. A “Multi BU workshop” was organized for problem-reframing and
further ideation and prototyping with BUs. A final selection process was
defined based on DT criteria and ZA’s strategic intent: customer value,
technical feasibility, passenger experience, group strategic alignment,
in addition to a separate ranking for “creative sparks”. The selected
concepts were then approved by the Group VP of Strategy. Thereafter,
they were shared again and promoted to business units who could
potentially host their development in their renewed product lines.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the researcher had first visited ADT in Toulouse, since it was
recognized as one of the new loci of innovation in ZA. Interested by the
PhD project and with several pending problems regarding concept
appropriation by BU, the local manager accepted and invited his
colleagues to provide relevant project documentation and interviews to
gain an understanding of the projects driven by Design Thinking.</p>
<h4 id="lower-deck-caselwd">Lower deck [caseLWD]</h4>
<p>As several projects had been launched as well as numerous ideation
sessions at ADT, the researcher had presented his analysis of the two
Design Thinking cases in March 2016. Among the conclusions, the C-K
mapping and project trajectories had revealed the recurrent topic of
using the aircraft lower deck (cargo area) as a means to embody several
concepts enabling solutions for waste management and aircraft turn
around.</p>
<p>The local manager had also a hunch for such topic as it had been quite
recurrent in the three years of existence of ADT, including a
provisional patent application with a former intern. As the team was
about to be renewed, he decided to request the former intern to come
back and support a new project dedicated to the lower deck use.</p>
<p>A first market study was launched with a consulting firm to evaluate
airline’s ticket yield management in addition to fleet evolution and
maintenance dates, to envision the size of lower deck market in addition
to its integration. The latter was critical as it implied modifying the
aircraft’s cargo area for passengers without disrupting airlines’
operations. The technical feasibility of this retrofit was studied first
by an external engineering firm and then deepen by an internal BU
dedicated to certifying specific aircraft customization. In parallel,
concepts were tested with several airlines’ executives, and the overall
business case was discussed with ZA Executive Committee board.</p>
<p>The project proved to be a success as several key client (airlines and
Airbus) formalized requests for proposals and project development
framing is ongoing (see announcements during last Aircraft Interiors
Exposition in Hamburg 2018). Moreover, several BUs are willing to take
ownership of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This project has to be read at the light of the Design
Thinking projects conducted at ADT and other projects followed by
closely by the ExCom.</p>
<h4 id="connected-cabin-caseconnected">Connected Cabin [caseConnected]</h4>
<p>The raising interest for connectivity and Big Data for aviation industry
had made its way into Zodiac Aerospace. Such topic was a perfect fit for
Zodiac Inflight Innovations who developed inflight entertainment
solutions and communication devices as well as Zodiac Data Systems
(antennae and inflight test equipment). The topic was rather convenient
for another BU such as Zodiac Air Catering Equipment whose market value
chain extends from the aircraft galley area to catering services
delivering the trolleys to aircraft doors.</p>
<p>Two members of the ZSTC, affiliated to Zodiac Inflight Innovations
started pitching the idea in front of the Executive Committee to launch
a project on Big Data services centred around an enhanced cabin with
connectivity hardware enabling machine to machine communication and
management. After two rounds with the support from a member of the ExCom
in charge of their business branch, they managed to precise the project
scope, potential business case, and needed resource to develop a
prototype to probe the market at 2017 Aircraft Interiors Exposition in
Hamburg.</p>
<p>A team was constituted with engineers from different BUs providing
equipment for the cabin and who had an interest in constituting the
connected cabin and developing associated services. The project moved on
quickly with bi-weekly reporting meetings followed by the VP of Strategy
and Business Development, and numerous side meetings. Moreover, the
ExCom made an open statement to investors that a project was being
launched to value aircraft connectivity. A cabin prototype was
manufactured with built-in connectivity features and scenarized for
airlines. It put forward the benefits of retrofitting hardware and
software providing value-added services smoothing airline operations and
client experience and satisfaction.</p>
<p>The prototype enabled collecting valuable feedback from potential
clients and following the exposition the project did not continue.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The researcher came around this case as he knew the two ZSTC
members and regularly attended ExCom meetings relative to technology and
innovation. They were keen on having him following the progress of the
project and keep track of concepts generated along, even before the
budgeting agreed by ExCom. This case benefited from the same context and
sponsorship as the Lower deck. Consequently, we can contrast them and
nuance their respective innovation potential of attraction.</p>
<h4 id="multi-bu-committee-casembu">Multi-BU committee [caseMBU]</h4>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The researcher was regularly invited by the CTO to attend
ExCom meetings relative to technology and innovation. These meetings
were usually labelled Multi-BU meetings following the interest of former
CEO (Olivier Zarrouati) to have a top-down approach urging new projects
(such as the Fuel Cell briefly exposed earlier) and also to offer space
to projects originating in one or multiple BUs bearing a strategic
importance. All of these projects addressed new markets, gaps in between
market segments by bringing forward new technologies or new product
concepts.</p>
<p>This case is approached not necessarily on the technical, engineering or
marketing content of the projects steered by the MBU committee, but
rather on the way decision-making was conducted by individuals and teams
attending these meetings. ExCom members were all present with leadership
from the CEO and VP of Business Development and Strategy. The meetings
were prepared by the MBU Director, also called Director of Large
Projects (<em>Directeur des Grands Projets</em>) with the support of the
Director in charge of product roadmaps. The job involved monthly
reporting of the projects to the mentioned VP as they would be
subsidized by top management budget (stemming from fees collected by the
holding on BUs).</p>
<p>The meetings occurred in average every quarter, sometimes punctuated by
other meetings in between for projects requiring an urgent strategic
decision: commercial support for business development, group strategy
relative to overall market positioning and budget.</p>
<p>The Committee operates as an alternative locus of (radical) innovation
compared to in-house R&amp;T and Product Development activities in BUs. It
emphasizes the interest of corporate management for entrepreneurship
across the group. It also differs from the ZSTC and members of the
Innovation Direction whose role leans towards support (processes and
tools) and networking for knowledge domains sustained by experts.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> &amp; <strong>Design Thinking for innovation management</strong> The purpose of
this paper is to study the adoption of Design Thinking methods for
multi-BU and B2B2C context. Design Theories are used to track
generativity of the design practice: user fixation and learning
metabolism supporting innovation management. Presented at 6th Creativity
Innovation Management (CIM) Community Workshop, first submitted and

<p><strong>2</strong> &amp; <strong>Decision-making in exploration project management</strong> In this
article directly submitted to CERN IdeaSquare Journal of Experimental
Innovation (2017), after a round of reviews for ICED 2017, we presented
an exploration project conducted over more than a decade. It showcases
the project’s timeline and what could be considered as an irrational due
to a preference reversal. We propose instead to extend the notion of
rationality with the existence of generative actions and the deliberate
will to reverse preferences. These are seen as means to manage the
unknown. Departing from optimization, design and generative processes
can support this extension and exploration. We consequently introduce
the notion <em>decisional ambidexterity</em>.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> &amp; <strong>Organizational Ambidexterity and innovation management</strong> This
paper addresses the hypothesis that organizational ambidexterity (OA)
can kill innovation. The first version called for the importance of
decision-making to understand the operationalization of OA as mentioned
by researchers in the field. We propose to leverage non-expected utility
decision-making based on Paper 2, but in reality with the feedback from
the research community we also recentred the presentation on
problem-solving as originally discussed by James March seminal paper
(March 
<a href="#ref-March1991">1991</a>). We stress the aporia of segregating
exploration from exploitation for a meaningful exploration as
generativity is otherwise biased and reduced. The latter revealed being
crucial to manage the unknown and consequently to innovate. Presented at
EURAM 2018 Conference Innovation SIG and will be rewritten based on
valuable collected feedback.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> &amp; <strong>Designing decision: managing the unknown</strong> This article
discusses the need to overcome the decision paradigm by embracing design
theories to extend the latter to the unknown. Four archetypes of
decisions based on design paths are presented corresponding to different
forms of collective action: learning, performance and organization.
Compared to the published paper, we extend the model with organizational
theories by integrating organizational constraints and hypothesis in the
decision design reasoning to generate and execute alternatives/decisions
to be managed in exploration/exploitation modes. Presented on several
occasions by Pascal Le Masson, debated with the researcher over the
PhD’s second year. After a first round of reviews, a modified version is
in press in the European Management Review. &amp; <strong>Theoretical paper</strong> The
traditional thought experiment of the decision to go out with an
umbrella/hat given the weather belief is used.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong> &amp; <strong>Ambidextrous decisions and corporate entrepreneurship</strong> Given
the anomaly and the proposed model, we will present two cases that can
explain their success and failure. These have a corporate
entrepreneurship taste and present features relating to decisional
ambidexterity, managing the unknown and organizing for it. One case
appears to have the right set of practices to succeed in its innovative
design and associated management whereas the other one struggles. The
comparison allows justifying the usefulness of the new model and ways to
implement certain practices. It is a working paper to be submitted by
the end of 2018 to conferences (to be determined) &amp; <strong>Airbus Development

<h1 id="chapter-synthesis">Chapter synthesis</h1>
<p>After having globally presented the general research methodology of the
PhD journey for the research questions refined over the last three
years, we have described in this chapter the actual research context.</p>
<p>The history of the aviation industry, its emergence, and its gradual
organization and segmentation with the numerous original actors explain
the dynamics of today’s market and positioning of players such as Zodiac
Aerospace.</p>
<p>This firm has developed specific innovation capabilities through several
decades of acquisitions, extending its market footprint. In the last
decade, we presented how centralization and gradual homogenization, new
coordination means and collective action patterns emerged to cope with
the unknown to be managed for future aircraft programs and markets. We
exposed also the difficulties for top/middle/local management to address
the challenges imposed by exploration project management with respect to
the underlying organization designs and market segmentation.</p>
<p>Finally, we introduced the case studies conducted at Zodiac Aerospace
and how these led to published and presented articles in journals and
conferences. These papers fit with the methodology of anomaly detection,
theoretical modelling and empirical testing. We explain how the other
cases support the researcher’s intervention, testing and
experimentation.</p>
