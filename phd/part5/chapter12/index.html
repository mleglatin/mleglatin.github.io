<p><em>The heart of a good work is a puzzle and an idea.</em>
<strong>Andrew Abbott</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the previous chapters, we have given further proof of the usefulness
of a model of mutual causality between exploration and exploitation:
decisional ambidexterity. The role of decision-designers and the
technology of organizing are sustained by interactions with the
decision-design in the unknown, mapping, categorizing oriented towards
by interdependencies and fixation effects. We have also sketched by
contrast the usefulness of having an engineering-oriented approach to
it: considering methodological approaches and objects to effectively
organize collective action.</p>
<p>We present in this chapter several other contributions of the researcher
to adapt process management and existing R&amp;T and Innovation practices in
Zodiac Aerospace. The initiative was part of a global program on Quality
Management System and for Operational Excellence following issues
encountered by a few BUs. The CTO was the process leader for <em>Design &amp;
Develop</em>, a key process for <em>Program Management</em>. He fought to have an
<em>Innovate</em> process, which finally was allocated by the Chief Operations
Officer despite not being directly linked with operations in the short
term.</p>
<p>It was an occasion to reinforce the value of innovation practices as
potential contributor and enhancer to operational issues. In other
words, we can think that operational issues faced in manufacturing
engineering and quality engineering, can be rooted in design choices.
This processual view can then be seen as an occasion to work around the
mutual causality between exploration and exploitation, instead of only
separating an innovation process and management as a totally isolated
regime compared to other organizational concerns.</p>
<p>The diagram below
(Fig.<a href="#fig:globalZAOS" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:globalZAOS">1</a>)
gives a global picture of the 3 main pillars (Drive, Execute, and

    <p>In the first section, we start by presenting the procedures written for
the ZAOS with the researcher’s contributions. They cover the <em>Design &amp;
Develop</em> and <em>Innovate</em> processes. The first defines a traditional new
product development, a representation of an exploitation regime, with a
strong influence from the optimization of project management. The second
process is then seen as upstream, and the researcher tried to distil it
in the model of decisional ambidexterity.</p>
<p>Then, we discuss the feedback gained from several R&amp;T managers community
workshops where the procedures were reviewed and where the researcher
had the occasion to discuss his model of decisional ambidexterity.
Similarly to the ZAOS procedures, these contributions show the issues of
surfacing an organizational metabolism against the duality of processes
and structure.</p>

<h2 id="group-procedures-design--develop-and-innovate">Group procedures: Design &amp; Develop and Innovate</h2>
<p>Following some quality and delay issues, corporate teams had launched
programs of <em>operational excellence</em> across the group. Originally, it
was formalized in key requirements for operations (supply chain,
manufacturing, industrialization, customer management). Later, it was
formalized into an update of the quality management system to prescribe
a set of key principles and procedures. The movement initiated for
critical process then moved &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; to tackle <em>Design &amp; Develop</em> and
<em>Innovate</em>.</p>
<p>The researcher had first participated to the <em>Program Management</em>
procedures writing to identify how R&amp;T activities could be articulated
(TRL assessment for risk management, technology acquisition and
integration and multi-BU projects). Then, an even more active
contribution was made to <em>Design &amp; Develop</em>. It was an occasion to
contribute and gain sufficient knowledge on exploitation regime.
Consequently, it helped formulate proposals for management devices
instilled by decisional ambidexterity in <em>Innovate</em> procedures.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>We present the linear view of designing and developing products in the
ZAOS. It is part of a more global processual perspective of the
exploitation regime that tries to avoid referring to organization
structures. Innovation is then placed as an upstream process, we discuss
its interface and assumptions.</p>
<p>Then, we show the <em>Innovate</em> procedure and how the researcher tried
accommodating decisional ambidexterity by introducing the governance
construct for road-mapping activities.</p>
  </div>

<h3 id="design--development-procedures">Design &amp; Development procedures</h3>
<p>In the figure below, we present the overall process of <em>Develop &amp;
Sustain</em> with inputs/outputs from other processes, as well as suppliers
and customers of different processes: Design &amp; Develop, Perform
industrialization, Perform maintainability engineering for repair, and
Maintain continued airworthiness.</p>
<p>The overall perspective of designing and developing makes several
assumptions on the linearity of the process. Customer have need, voiced
to the business unit through bidding teams and programs framing the
undertaking waterfalled to different underlying processes (see
figure.<a href="#fig:globalZAOS" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:globalZAOS">1</a>).
As we see below in
Figure.<a href="#fig:DesignDevelopProcessCard" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:DesignDevelopProcessCard">2</a>,
the suppliers/customers in bold purple letters are other processes
providing and expecting actions and deliverables (note: circular
references are possible because of iterations).</p>

  </figcaption>


</figure>

<p>Given several inputs and interactions with other processes,
responsibility, accountability, support, consultation and information
are distributed among functional activities (jobs), with some overlap,
interactions but with a global movement forward, the sub-processes are
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create Technical Proposal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analyse Customer Needs &amp; Capture Requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform Preliminary Design Analysis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create Detailed Design Data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform Verification and Qualification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain or Support Certification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configuration Management</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This exploitation regime is heavily dependent on the client’s demand and
makes the assumption the client knows to some extent how to formulate
requirements to a congruent business unit (bidding and engineering team)
capable to discuss and support in the formulation of engineering
specifications and rules to conduct product development.</p>
<p>Numerous debates during writing workshops (for program management,
develop &amp; sustain, as well as innovation) took place because of
differences in organization design. The struggle was hard to adopt the
view of the quality management system which enforces a strong processual
view. The process should be high-level enough to be transposable between
business units. The compromise found to avoid specificities was to add
some depth to the processes for organizations to better identify with
maturity matrices.</p>

<h4 id="project-based-management-principles">Project-based management principles</h4>
<p>Project management principles are induced by the framing and management
of overarching programs. They impose the breakdown of the activities in
work packages supported by team. Resources are picked among whatever
organization is in place following the matrix-form (Galbraith

<a href="#ref-Galbraith1971">1971</a>).</p>
<p>Resources are allocated depending on customer requirements and derived
specifications. What is rather surprising in the writing of these
activities and responsibilities is the implicit reference to the
necessary competencies and capabilities to continuously be able to
develop new products and cope with adaptation to change</p>
<h4 id="rt-and-innovation-interface">R&amp;T and Innovation interface</h4>
<p>As we can see in the previous figure, they have linearized the R&amp;T
activities, through the TRL assessment (Mankins

<a href="#ref-Mankins2009">2009</a>). It corresponds to a stage-gate equivalent
(Cooper 
<a href="#ref-Cooper2007">2007</a>). Of course, such linear and adaptive
view is more appropriate for incremental innovation. Product development
and engineering refers to a pool of technologies capable of being
integrated as the TRL freezes the integration environment to measure the
technology maturation. So, if the engineering rules for products remain
stable enough and that these are made clear, it can be considered that
maturity assessment will filter and perhaps bring adjustments to
technologies.</p>
<p>Consequently, when it comes to major innovations initiatives, they would
originate from another process that necessarily challenges or even
by-passes traditional adaptive and maturation processes. From the
researcher’s viewpoint and as discussed on multiple occasions with the
CTO, the quality management system had to sanctuarise these processes in
<em>Innovate</em>. Indeed, <em>Design &amp; Develop</em> restricts its scope to a
traditional exploitation regime with its lot of hypotheses on nature of
risks, certainties, fixations and marginal correction of biases &amp;
heuristics.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>The structure of the ZAOS, with the cross-referencing of processes of
different nature, forces to build coherence between them as well as
delimiting their perimeter. The scope and the risk of leaving activities
unmanaged was taken care of by the ZAOS project team. On some occasions,
it was also circumvented by using maturity matrices to provide
additional detail on how activities can be conducted with underlying
competencies and capabilities.</p>
<p>Overall, <em>Design &amp; Develop</em> describes the exploitation regime fed by
some optimizations that can be decided as they improve product design &amp;
development with technologies capable of being integrated.</p>
<p>From the decisional ambidexterity perspective, it provides enough ground
to envision designing decisions capable of changing products, their
development and required capability. Since, we face a traditional model
of ambidexterity, decisional ambidexterity model is bound to be upstream
but encourage to disentangle fixations effects and interdependencies.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="innovate-procedures">Innovate procedures</h3>
<p>The <em>Innovate</em> process was the last in being written in the ZAOS
program. Some place had been made already for incremental innovation
with more traditional R&amp;T activities focusing on technology maturation
made available to product development and program management.</p>
<p>A preliminary round between the CTO, his North America delegate, the
Intellectual Property director, and the PhD Candidate was organized to
provide an overall framing. This original draft helped giving some
directions to the writing workshop participants. The main issue was
defining whether or not the process should consider product design and
innovation, in addition to technologies. And more common to other
processes in the ZAOS, sub-processes and topics were reallocated and
articulated differently under the umbrella of the agreed main processes
after several iterations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Define, Implement and Maintain Product &amp; Technology Road maps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage Research &amp; Technology Projects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage patents and create patent landscape</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Innovate</em> complements what exploitation doesn’t cover. In other words,
it feeds exploration regime. It is regarded <em>upstream</em> to provide
technologies to improve continuously product along its roadmap. However,
the group quickly insisted on approaching the subject with additional
processes catching other forms of innovation. It was necessary due to
the variety of products, sometimes relying on several common
technologies (material, composite, flammability, electronics, EMI,
etc.), and due to the value of design and layouts for cabin and seats
equipment.</p>
<p>Consequently, the working group had to precise the articulation of other
innovation streams and practices contributing to exploration and
differing from the linear, continuous and adaptive view of innovation.</p>

<p>As we show, in the following paragraphs, decisional ambidexterity
explains the nature of these innovation streams contributing in more
complex ways and differing from traditional models of ambidexterity.</p>
<h4 id="revisiting-the-innovation-funnel">Revisiting the innovation funnel</h4>
<p>In order to provide a basis for discussion, the researcher used
traditional ways of representing innovation. The famous funnel implies
uncertainty reduction through a stage-gated with an hypothetical target
and environment. It is rather fixated. He then proposed to use its
parameters and assumptions to show that other innovations, differing
from technology maturation could be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Technologies and Products can be created but do not have yet a
market</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Markets can be created but do not have yet a product or technology</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These two simple statements encourage after defining what the funnel
is<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, to envision other scenarios and concepts to be decided. The
figure
<a href="#fig:InnovationFunnel" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:InnovationFunnel">5</a>
below incites to revisit the innovation funnel, not only to show the
necessary feedback loops between gates to reach an a priori defined
target, but also to show the porosity of the funnel and its
elasticity/plasticity as new decisions rule its scope and curvature.</p>

<p>The colour code identifies different types of concepts relying on a
specific decision-making. The light blue refer to technologies and
(design) concepts that can fit the environment and adjust with existing
engineering design rules.</p>
<p>Dark blue is for new concepts that tend to modify the shape of the
funnel. Some can be fully discarded (red-cross) because they are decided
to be out of scope, e.g. they require escalating decision and involve
strategic discussions challenging the overall model of business or
firm’s identity.</p>
<p>Others may be left in a <em>parking lot</em> (yellow) as the decision requires
deeper value management to understand how to generate a future fit with
organizations: e.g. the lower deck project.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the dark blue concepts may require to search or support
suppliers in developing technologies, or inversely searching or
co-innovating with customers and users to shape the future market. The
Icing Conditions Detection project revealed several features of this
interplay between technology and market design.</p>
<h3 id="decision-design-and-innovation-governance">Decision-design and Innovation governance</h3>
<p>Introducing such interactions touching upon organizational metabolism,
the writing team had to provide a means to manage such decisions. They
relied on existing practices, i.e. road mapping activities for
technologies and products.</p>
<p>First, the group included the product road map as part of <em>Innovate</em>
whereas in the past it was absent and only focused on technologies
(R&amp;T). It allowed to be more representative of <em>less</em> business units who
focus rather on design features (cabin and seats), besides common topics
such as materials.</p>
<p>Secondly, the main issue raised by writing workshop participants was the
handover between innovation teams and product development and
sales/marketing. The issue was not the handover dossier nor technical
items, but rather to have some buy-in from them. Moreover, enforcing a
top-down was not necessarily the solution according to participants’
experiences.</p>
<p>With the CTO, they proposed to introduce a governance body to
orchestrate the alignment and change of roadmaps for technologies and
products. The American colleague (CTO’s delegate for the Americas) was
not very comfortable with it as it has a stronger meaning than in France
(more related to the firm’s Board). Nevertheless, due to the weight and
twist they wanted to give to this management of decisions and concepts,
they kept it. The procedure asks to organize meetings with BU
stakeholders, invited experts from the group (if relevant), and the
group CTO. Interactions in meetings are encouraged then to discuss what
can change for the funnel and in between roadmaps. The point is to
discuss what makes decision and position concepts accordingly. Experts
can bring additional knowledge. And the CTO can spot opportunities
outside of the BU, or find connections for multi-BU projects.</p>
<p>In other words, we insisted on the innovation potential of attraction,
resurfacing rules for decisions on product engineering and development,
in order to fit to them or redesign them with according knowledge and
organizational change. The word metabolism wasn’t used but the
interactions and the management device through this governance body is
here to support such phenomenon.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>The <em>Innovate</em> process defined as complement to the exploitation regime
in <em>Design &amp; Develop</em> offers a first to reconsider a reductive model of
ambidexterity for R&amp;T activities and articulate other innovation
streams. Decisional ambidexterity is used to condition exploration by
exploitation parameters and constraints usually represented through a
funnel.</p>
<p>Given the obstacles reported by R&amp;T managers and innovation
practitioners, they proposed to work on the articulation of their
activities with exploitation regime. Bringing interactions and managing
them around fixations effects and interdependencies through the lens of
<em>decisional ambidexterity</em>, allows to propose new means of actions for
existing objects such as road maps. The decision design is distilled in
the process and embodied by <em>governance</em> of roadmaps during meetings.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="approach-and-validation-with-rt-managers">Approach and validation with R&amp;T Managers</h2>
<p>Former <em>Aérazur</em> group of business units had their own quality
management system and shared common practices as well similar
technologies (fabric, composite material, injection moulding). When the
R&amp;T activities had been gradually established in 2013, they had set up
an exchange group with the recently appointed R&amp;T managers. In late
2016, after a year without meetings, the group was set up again, and
enlarged to other business units in France, i.e. not restricted to
former <em>Aérazur</em>. The researcher was already known to these managers,
had worked with them on their management practice, and had consulted
them to collect input for innovation procedures update (before and
during ZAOS project).
They held five meetings between 2017 and 2018 to discuss several topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Key Performance Indicators for R&amp;T management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handover between R&amp;T and other BU stakeholders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expertise and technologies knowledge access across BUs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decision-making and design practices for R&amp;T and advanced concepts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The agenda was set by the main organizer and the researcher. The group
was consulted beforehand to adjust according to their interests and were
requested to present their perspective on agenda’s topics.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>Below, we share feedbacks collected through the five workshops organized
by the R&amp;T managers community. The researcher consulted this group of
people outside the procedure writing workshops.</p>
<p>The researcher tested also how decisional ambidexterity could be adapted
to the process management perspective of the new quality management
system in addition to complementary methods and practices.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="rethinking-evaluation-of-concepts">Rethinking evaluation of concepts</h3>
<p>Several projects hosted in BU’s respective R&amp;T departments struggled to
beyond TRL6, i.e. the gate beyond which the Product Development
engineering should take over. All BUs had a history of numerous product
innovation, technology development, and most had been successful before
delimiting an up-stream activity (R&amp;T, Innovation or Advanced Concepts).
Of course, many other projects had failed or led to high risks taking
when developing products for clients.</p>
<p>As we have stressed earlier, TRL assessments consider environment being
fixed, so entering the evaluation is made for a given target with its
integration assumptions. Several discussions were oriented on how the
environment could be shaped to create a generative fit, as they agreed
it couldn’t be so deterministic for some technologies and products.</p>
<p>Following three meetings, one of the R&amp;T managers reported he had
several TRL6 technologies waiting to handover to product development and
industrialisation. He had organized several meetings with stakeholders,
but industrialisation and operations wouldn’t show up; after several
attempts, projects went further with the support of a salesman. Such
initiatives led to tensions between departments despite having verbal
and signed agreement following the organized meetings (email and signing
sheets).</p>
<p>Consequently, he proposed to create an interface for such meetings. The
idea of having management device to channel interactions was
acknowledged crucial. They made the parallel with brainstormings without
a proper coach: rules and isolated brainwriting give voice to all ideas.
An Excel spreadsheet was formalised to decide on concepts interest.
Criteria were defined and given a weight by BU stakeholders. The
objective was first to decide on the interest and value of concepts.</p>
<p>However, the second underlying objective was to envision the possibility
of reviewing some criteria (with a poor value or ranking) in order to
identify what had to change in the BU to enable the decision:
engineering rules, client relationship, use cases, suppliers, technical
feasibility, manufacturability, etc.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>They managed to emphasize the cruciality of discussing what makes
decisions for R&amp;T and innovation concepts to better work out the
articulation with exploitation regime.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, decisional ambidexterity applied heuristics developed
during the meetings allowed reconnecting innovation streams with the
gaps created by traditional models of ambidexterity.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="the-augmented-proof-of-concept">The augmented Proof of Concept</h3>
<p>During one of the meetings, they also took the opportunity to discuss
the Hypoxia Protection project. The several practices of opening the
project were presented such as discussing digital and physical mock-ups
with stakeholders.</p>
<p>The point was to try to test the idea of revisiting the traditional
proof of concept as defined in a TRL assessment. A prototype presented
to stakeholders to check pre-defined criteria could lead to a
standstill. So, they debated over how they could discuss the evolution
of criteria thus enabling other concepts.</p>
<p>To do so, the researcher proposed to work on what an engineering model
is. He took an external example (aircraft engine) which can be described
with simple equations at a certain order in functional analysis. He
insisted on specifying assumptions and impacts on engineering rules,
interfaces between sub-systems and organization mirroring. Consequently,
they could discuss how simple variations on equation parameters could
radically engineering rules and organization. For instance, one can
shift from a turbojet to a turbofan by playing on inlet cross section,
and shift even to open rotor turbofans by making the cross section
infinite. The first shift has a strong impact on mechanical gear and
shaft system. The second shift changes the physics altogether, since
part of the engine is unducted, so propellers’ equations have to be
integrated. Such simple tricks in the model handling ripple out through
an engineering organization as well as for an entire business unit and
environment.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    The discussions with R&amp;T managers revealed their interest but also the
difficulty to transpose to their BU and engineering the method. Indeed,
formalizing their practice hasn’t been done systematically across the
group and over the years. However, it also leaves some slack as well as
risks and opportunities to innovate around the non-totally-explicit
models of engineering. Such setting gives room for high levels of
reconfigurability but with threats of leaving interdependencies and
fixations in a blind spot.
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="what-if-to-articulate-strategic-intent-and-organization-design">&ldquo;What If?&rdquo; to articulate strategic intent and organization design</h3>
<p>Finally, the researcher discussed hacking to value emergent strategies.
One R&amp;T manager was very receptive and presented us his way of designing
his strategy. His business unit has been facing market share losses and
difficulties in opening new markets because of lowering entry barriers
(known technology) and regulations.</p>
<p>New growth opportunities had to be found and these would be out of the
aircraft industry. Sticking to the history of technology transfers and
genericity to different systems integration, he developed alternatives.
The methodology formalizing technology roadmaps definition and creation
was used to identify hackable parameters. Indeed, he acknowledged
presenting to his managing directors highly uncertain Net Present Value
calculations and business models. However, his presentations aimed at
showing how they could become true or less uncertain by identifying
means of action to uncover the share of unknown. Another representative
from another BU, shared a history of business plans requested by his
local financial director who systematically requested them. He used
these models to show the absurdity of such planning per se, and twisted
to identify what had to be redesigned internally or in the environment
to enable the business cases.</p>
<p>The meeting’s participants acknowledged such practices. In some way or
another, they had performed similar hacking in their own fashion and
with variations. For instance, one relied on formalized business plans
for his financial director not only to &ldquo;cheat&rdquo; and gain his approval,
but also to point at where the effort should be put to make these cases
come true. As for the previous modelling effort for engineering and
organizing, they stressed the difficulty in transposing across BUs. The
R&amp;T managers were more keen in having a set of heuristics and method to
adapt and apply them to their specific practice.</p>
<p>There is no <em>one best way</em> so it encouraged the researcher to find
generic enough. We didn’t take the time to introduce decisional
ambidexterity as it has been formalized here in the thesis’ manuscript
or in 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/publication/pub-lemasson2018/">our publication</a>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>The meetings held with R&amp;T managers from the French BUs were rich in
debate to discuss management issues. During these meetings and the
evolving agendas, we tried to test some declinations of decisional
ambidexterity before its actual formalization.</p>
<p>We see that they came with their own practices and tricks to overcome
limitations of traditional models of ambidexterity. However, they report
on the difficulties to have a systematic way of playing on fixations
effects and interdependencies to value their project’s portfolio. In
other words, it encourages to work on a <em>baseline</em> that would help them
to reconciliate the tensions between the models organizational
ambidexterity and exploration projects.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-synthesis-decisional-ambidexterity-enhancing-process-management">Chapter synthesis: decisional ambidexterity enhancing process management</h2>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>In this chapter, we have presented how the researcher contributed to the
quality management system through the <em>Design &amp; Develop</em> and <em>Innovate</em>
processes. We tried to accommodate decisional ambidexterity within the
processual perspective and it reveals some difficulties circumvented by
the introduction of the notion of <em>governance</em> for road-mapping
activities.</p>
<p>The discussions during workshops with the R&amp;T managers from French BUs
reveal also the complexity for them to implement approaches extending
limitations of traditional models of ambidexterity. They recognize the
results of the thesis, they identify with patterns of decisional
ambidexterity, but still struggle to implement or develop their own
<em>technology of organizing</em>. The disentanglement of fixations effects and
interdependencies is complex and perhaps even chaotic. However, the
interactive meetings proposed in the procedure to discuss and design
decisions opened some possibilities, as some colleagues had implemented
similar practices or were about to.</p>
<p>Our work trying to collect and propose means of formalizing decisional
ambidexterity is not finished despite having tested ideas of
implementation. The logics appear quite normal to them, as it was also
recognized by the former CEO and discussed for the Multi-BU committee.</p>
<p>This chapter closes our work at Zodiac Aerospace and our testing of the
decisional ambidexterity supporting its validation as an extension of
models of ambidexterity. As shown here, it provides means of action to
avoid the limitations we had extensively discussed in previous chapters
when starting the PhD journey. The following chapters will discuss what
we have achieved so far before concluding this thesis.</p>
