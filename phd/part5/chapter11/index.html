          <div class="article-style">
            <p>Keeping up with our research agenda, now that we have validated our
model with two comparable case studies, we engage with the presentation
of how the researcher intervened in the firm to test <em>in vivo</em> the model
of decisional ambidexterity. It allows us to further specify the
subtleties of the model and the management requirements revealed by the
mutual conditioning between exploration and exploitation.</p>
<p>We show how the project trajectory was set and guided with design of
decisions constantly articulated with fixations and interdependencies so
that the engineering practice encapsulated in the project could be
largely grounded and supported by stakeholders. Furthermore, we exhibit
how this R&amp;T funded project aiming for a potentially new product
embedding TRL6 technologies, managed its organizational ties to find
sufficient echoes inducing the regeneration of engineering capabilities
enabling future new product development.</p>
<p>We come back on a management device we often referred to inter-BU cases
such as the Design Thinking cases, the Lower Deck and the Connected
Cabin. The Multi-BU committee, created in 2012 by a former CEO, was an
opportunity to foster top-down projects as well as some bottom-up
projects requiring strong sponsorship enabling corporate
entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>It is not a case study comparable to others, as it cannot be identified
as project on its own. However, it is rather a <em>governance body for
radical innovation</em>. This locus of innovation within the conglomerate of
SMEs can be analysed through the lens of decisional ambidexterity and we
propose to specify some of its characteristics.</p>
<p>This chapter further tests our model of decisional ambidexterity and
continues justifying its validity to extend models of ambidexterity and

<h2 id="hypoxia-probing-and-structuring-the-ecosystem-interdependencies">Hypoxia: probing and structuring the ecosystem interdependencies</h2>
<p>The case presentation (see 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#hypoxia-protection---researchers-intervention">section</a>) gave a first global picture of the project’s
trajectory and context. The specificity of this case is that the
researcher actively participated to the project on the R&amp;T manager’s
request.</p>
<p>Below, we propose to present what was specifically done to implement
heuristics of decisional ambidexterity and its induced effects. We
picture the trajectory with the global descriptors in Figure
<a href="#fig:HypoxiaTraj" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:HypoxiaTraj">2</a>,
as well as the phenomena relative to model of coordination and
collective action, and its innovation potential of attraction.</p>
<h3 id="organizational-context-and-project-target">Organizational context and project target</h3>
<p>The Zodiac Oxygen Systems Europe (ZOSE), whose Engineering and Product
Development board is common with its twin sister BU in the United States
(ZOSU) is one of the two market leaders in pilot, cabin crew and
passenger oxygen masks in addition to oxygen tanks. In the past decades,
with ageing patents, an increase of replacement parts providers with an
<em>Parts Manufacturer Approval</em> (PMA), the risk of obsolescence and market
share losses became higher to the point that Engineering Director
included it in its roadmap and practices the necessity to think of
market regeneration.</p>
<p>One of ZOSE flagship product, EROS mask (see Figure
<a href="#fig:EROSmask" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:EROSmask">1</a>
below) along with an equivalent product offered by the competition (B/E
Aerospace), are provided to aircraft manufacturers on catalogue. They
are issued with a TSO (Technical Standard Order) that allows to certify
a piece of equipment with sufficient autonomy over the aircraft
manufacturer. It induces then several design rules with associated
qualification standards.</p>
<p>The equipment was originally developed upon transferred and licensed
technologies from the US to support equipment design and supply for
Dassault (Darrieulat 
<a href="#ref-Darrieulat1993">1993</a>). Later, in the 1960s,
the engineering department developed its own capabilities and winning
its contracts on its own. In a pure entrepreneurial spirit, Georges
Gutman, then development engineer, created a oxygen regulator solving
several limitations such as having oxygen on demand, making breathing
more comfortable.</p>

<p>Improvements were made including the innovation of having an
expandable/retractable harness to adjust with the single push of a
button the mask to any face whilst guaranteeing a perfect fit and air
tightness. Smoke and fire protection with fogging prevention were also
developed with a fixed or removable lens attached on the oro-nasal
piece.</p>
<p>Given a historical and established dominant design, market players have
put on the top of their priorities the urgency of reinforcing safety and
preparing for the unexpected with new designs. Indeed, several threats
of obsolescence due to ageing patents had been identified, and the
aviation ecosystem was concerned by some isolated cases of hypoxia<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>,
usually due to other equipment failure. A CleanSky2 project, with Airbus
as partner, made a call for proposal considering the new safety
regulation requiring extended mask wear whenever a pilot is alone on
duty in the cockpit.</p>
<p>It was then a proposal to rethink the ergonomics and features of the
oxygen mask for this new restrictive requirement. Indeed, several
feedback had pointed out that pilots were not following the rule because
of the discomfort caused by the mask on their face. However, ensuring a
pilot safety, whilst alone in a cockpit, is a first step before removing
the copilot position. The flight engineer was removed several decades
ago, so it appears to think of one-man cockpit before even examine
unmanned commercial aircrafts.</p>
<h3 id="project-trajectory">Project trajectory</h3>
<p>As explained in the case presentation (see 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#hypoxia-protection---researchers-intervention">section</a>), the researcher had first
proposed a C-K mapping of the Open Innovation Challenge in order to
position the proposed concepts relatively to the dominant design. And,
as he was familiar with the R&amp;T manager who was first in charge of the
project, he was requested to support their exploration and their
methodology.</p>
<p>They had already been working for 6 months on the project. Several
brainstorming sessions, workshops with industrial designers were held
and digital mock-ups had been generated. However, they were confronted
with a dilemma. They were expected to provide a product concept to
Airbus: a product requirement had been issued largely inspired by the
general pilot oxygen mask but with some changed words calling for
innovative design. For instance, the word <em>mask</em> was replaced by
<em>device</em>, the adjective <em>disruptive</em> had been added on some
requirements, and they also referred to a future cockpit without clearly
specifying its characteristics.</p>
<p>The researcher supported them in clustering their previously generated
concepts, and in creating meaning around new product categories. The
clustering was eased by the use of C-K theory. But, more importantly,
the researcher insisted on the team’s ability to discuss the future
decision of committing to a product design and development. So, the
interactions with the client should explicitly rely on the extent of
their design effort provided and their capabilities, as well as the
necessity to discuss fixations and interdependencies. They were
encouraged to present the design method, the clustering and how they
made sense of the uncertainties and the unknown surrounding the
ill-defined problem.</p>
<p>The figure
<a href="#fig:HypoxiaTraj" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:HypoxiaTraj">2</a>
below shows the trajectory of the project. Initially, the concept could
have been simply an extreme optimization ($d^+$) of the existing mask.
It was a simple and easy way to identify action necessary for legacy
products. It would allow anchoring to the dominant design and
established product roadmap.</p>
<p>The necessity of wearing the mask for extended periods of time actually
ensures that before an actual emergency, the pilot is wearing the mask
in a standby mode, so the researcher pushed forward the nuance of
prevention to counterbalance the emergency mode. It created a category
discriminant to make sense of the generated concepts through
brainstormings and industrial design.</p>
<p>Consequently, it allowed to consider two other concepts to decide that
would fall under genericity ($d^{gen}$) and alternative situation
($d^{alt}$) as they wished for an evolving regulation where the nuance
between prevention and emergency is specified. Finally, since the future
cockpit is yet undefined, the potential threat of a guaranteed air tight
cockpit would make oxygen mask pointless ($d^*$)? Furthermore, without
fully exploring such disruption, they took into account nearby equipment
that could be integrated with the oxygen device ($d^{alt}$).</p>
<p>All of the designed decisions where mapped through C-K with the project
team input, and iteratively discussed so that they would gain in
familiarity with the model. The researcher also encouraged to come up
with means of avoiding isolation of the project within the engineering
department. The project manager also repeatedly came to ask specific
questions to the researcher at the beginning as the heuristics were not
made clear enough; so some short sessions were quite randomly set at the
beginning with him and his lead engineer, to give some guidance to think
of the different decisions categories and the required engineering
design.</p>
<p>In the following subsections, we offer more detail on the benefits of
decisional ambidexterity and its practice through the researcher’s
intervention.</p>
<h3 id="a-conservative-client-asking-for-radical-innovation">A conservative client asking for radical innovation</h3>
<h4 id="paradoxical-request">Paradoxical request</h4>
<p>We stated that the team was facing a dilemma when the researcher was
called. The request made by the client was a mix of encouraged
innovative design, but at the same time heavily constrained by mimetic
requirements from existing dominant design. It created a lot of
confusion and they were quite lost on ranking critical to quality
requirements. They also doubted on the client for knowing what they were
expecting from the product design.</p>
<p>The request was already ambidextrous in itself but perhaps in the wrong
way as it was prescribed in an almost client-supplier relationship
(Airbus to ZOSE). The team had the expectation that Airbus knew their
need, and symmetrically ZOSE would engineer whatever is physically
possible as long as it sustains and extends the product line. Reaching
out for methodical innovative design, managed value management and
project-based concern for engineering capabilities are clearly
formulated despite being an open-ended exploration project funded by
CleanSky2 program.</p>
<p>This is where decisional ambidexterity can help specifying the nuances
between pure exploitation (prescription, engineering and development)
and exploration. Decisional ambidexterity overcomes paradoxical tension
of non-mutual conditioning.</p>
<h4 id="exploiting-for-exploration">Exploiting for exploration</h4>
<p>From the perspective of C-K theory, having such specified dominant
design makes it easier to build the rest of the concepts. So, the
researcher did it whilst also re-using some of the mapping made for Open
Innovation Challenge. The researcher then encouraged the project members
to anchor the value of the generated concept to established requirement
by specifying the distant and its nature.</p>
<p>It allowed to make a design document presenting three main concepts
categories, with a digital mock-up each, stressing how they came about
these options. The researcher had insisted on the necessity to explain
their method, their line of thought and its decision parameters so that
they could better discuss underlying hypotheses that Airbus may be
deliberately or not hiding: interactions with other projects, cockpit
elements, physical constraints, or just a vision for their future
cockpit.</p>
<p>It has also forced Airbus to be more specific and answer questions that
they did not expected to. For example, several debates gravitated around
the head clearance (i.e. distance between the cockpit sealing and
pilot’s head top) as some design features encouraged the use of
surrounding space for prevention. The concepts considering the
integration with other cockpit elements such as the seat (engineering
knowledge and capability exist at Zodiac Seats France), forced Airbus to
solicit FAA/EASA to start thinking carefully about potential evolution
of regulations.</p>
<h3 id="opening-the-project-routines-to-the-organization">Opening the project routines to the organization</h3>
<h4 id="stress-tested-proof-of-concepts">Stress-tested proof of concepts</h4>
<p>The concept categories presented and the design method were really
helpful in discussing the unknown fraction of the project, but also key
to articulate the interdependencies of the future product and
technologies. Due to the nature of the requirements demanded by the
client, several interdependencies could have been easily challenged.</p>
<p>With the project manager’s support, the researcher encouraged the need
to specify ripples caused by different generated features. The purpose
was to find knowledge interactions and conjunctions triggered by the
designed decisions. The manager organized open weekly meetings inviting
several representatives from quality, purchasing, testing, prototyping,
repair shop and other engineering sub-units. The aim of these sessions
was to identify fixations held by these sub-organizations and the
interdependent ties maintained by their engineering or management
practices. Consequently, the project team was able to specify further
the different concept categories.</p>
<h4 id="looking-for-organizational-echoes">Looking for organizational echoes</h4>
<p>Nevertheless, the most stimulating side-effect of this practice was not
the manoeuvre of the project trajectory to provide a well-defined and
methodological approach to the client to co-explore the unknown. It was
the reflexion of these practices in BU sub-organizations. The
interactions organized around decision parameters, product design
features and requirements were the occasion to regenerate their
capabilities.</p>
<p>The Engineering Director launched several side mini-projects within some
of his engineering units to address radical changes in product
architecture. These have proven the technical feasibility of some
features envisioned in the decision categories, and some opened new
perspectives for product lines. For example, the air regulator has
always been integrated in the oro-nasal piece because of pressure losses
between the system and mouth/nose. Distancing the regulator through a
hose was unimaginable however interactions during the open-meetings to
update and consult BU stakeholders and prototyping allowed reconsidering
its engineering and interfaces between sub-units. It also invited them
to think of product systems and cockpit integration differently, and
opened possibilities to change the engineering organization.</p>
<p>And finally, despite having been made fun of at the beginning of the
project by other BU members, some of the originally generated concepts
were indeed seen as coming out of the blue. These concepts were in the
end grounded with exploitation regime and the distance created by
exploration was sustained by knowledge identification, generation, and
initiated organizational, generative learning and change. Decisional
ambidexterity helped stimulating organizational metabolism.</p>

<td>Working on the mutual conditioning of exploration by exploitation parameters helped organizing learning and disentangling interdependencies, and organization design fixations. For instance, the air regulator is integrated in the oro-nasal piece, and both are mirrored two engineering sub-units working tightly. Questioning it through the designed alternatives, opening the project to stakeholders, and prototyping, facilitated the launch of an internal side project to think of how it could be made and integrated differently. It encouraged to work other engineering interdependencies with other engineering sub-units.</td>

<h2 id="mbu-committees-a-steering-committee-looking-for-purpose">MBU Committees: a steering committee looking for purpose</h2>
<p>The Multi-BU committee was established by the ExCom to launch top-down
projects as well as to offer a place for bottom-up initiatives. It was
created in 2012 hosting to steer key projects whose strategic interest
was acknowledged by the ExCom. For instance, the fuel cell development
was initiated by the former CEO as the greener aircraft initiative
became more and more important in the aviation sector. A project team
was constituted and hosted by Zodiac Oxygen Systems Europe as a
potential growth driver and technology transfers. The project aimed at
developing the technology for aircraft use with the promise of having
multiple sources to be reuse across the aircraft (electrical power,
water and heating). The project was conducted in partnership with two
aircraft manufacturers and funded by European programs.</p>
<p>The MBU committee also hosted numerous other projects that would call
less for a new BU, but rather insist on inter-BU collaboration; others
were rather intra-BU bearing a strategic interest as it was developing a
<em>game-changing</em> technologies.</p>
<p>As we explain, in the case presentation (see 
<a href="https://mleglatin.github.io/phd/part2/chapter5/#multiBU-committee">section</a>), the committee with its
quarterly meetings was a locus of innovation to give a chance to
entrepreneurial spirit<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    We propose to discuss some features of this MBU activity at the light of
decisional ambidexterity, since it hosted several projects we have
discussed previously such as the Lower Deck and the Connected Cabin. We
specify the nature of the discussions held in these meetings, the impact
of project’s trajectory and how it relates to decision-designing.
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="organizational-context-and-ecosystem">Organizational context and ecosystem</h3>
<p>First of all, it is important to understand that the MBU committee was
set at a time when the homogenization of the conglomerate of SMEs was
barely starting. The re-branding of business units was starting and the
rate of mergers &amp; acquisitions was diminishing.</p>
<p>The business units were exploiting their respective niches, and ZA as a
group already covered a wide range of equipment and systems across the
aircraft. The former CEO as well as other ExCom members, are all
engineers and have a propensity for technical discussions. Niches were
segregated with a variety of technologies, with high entry barriers. BU
managers and the ExCom helped identifying M&amp;A targets to be the first
entrant to gain a strong foothold on these markets. The pattern had been
reproduced across all existing ZA market segments.</p>
<p>The ExCom, as reported by the former CEO, wanted to leave a strong
responsibility at each BU level, with Profits &amp; Losses reporting, a
certain financial autonomy with a holding consolidation. They avoided
imposing projects to BUs. The MBU committee was then a means to drive
exploration for BUs through technological development. Some technical
barriers (engineering, certification, market interest, supply chain,
etc.) would be extensively studied so that one or several BUs would take
it onboard. If necessary they arbitrate on the project’s allocation
depending on how the ExCom judges the BU capacity to sustain the
development. The former CEO also saw the MBU as a management device to
overcome the limited <em>bandwidth</em> of BU and Divisions managers. It is
also the role of branch executives (ExCom members) to seize and support
these initiatives.</p>
<h3 id="managing-exploration-added-value-for-the-conglomerate">Managing exploration added value for the conglomerate</h3>
<p>The committee was a locus for discussion, where top management met with
middle management, engineers, designers and marketers. All ExCom members
were former engineers, including middle management and BU managers. As
confirmed by the former CEO, he encouraged debate on the quality of
models and input data used to make decisions on the technologies,
products to be developed. The VP of Business Development and Strategy
would usually question the Intellectual Property and aircraft
manufacturers’ risk of claiming primacy. The former group CEO and branch
CEOs would dig into the details of the project, questioning engineering
topics, partnerships, competition, market shares, suppliers and
potential launch customers.</p>
<p>Whenever they felt the model was stress-tested enough given their
knowledge on the topic or insight they had from their interactions with
other executives inside/outside the firm, they would delegate the
responsibility to the BU.</p>
<h3 id="advantages-conditions-and-limitations---former-ceos-feedback-to-the-researcher">Advantages, conditions and limitations - former CEO’s feedback to the researcher</h3>
<p>Among the limitations we can find in the MBU device, some can be seen by
reflecting on the difference between two cases such as the Connected
Cabin and the Lower Deck. These two show that despite benefiting from
the same context, they did not hold similar results. Of course we could
go on listing numerous reasons, but they were treated alike during MBU
and additional ExCom meetings. In other words, the same discussion on
hypotheses, input data and modelling was heavily challenged by board
members. Such pattern has been reported for executives not familiar with
topics (Loch, Mähring, and Sommer 
<a href="#ref-Loch2017">2017</a>), but here, the
ExCom is made exclusively of engineers who have cultivated over their
careers a deep interest for technologies and applied sciences. They also
have market and ecosystem knowledge through other firm’s corporate
governance participation and external networks (consortia, group of
industrial partners, conferences, etc.). For example, the former CEO had
good knowledge for both topics before they were launched as actual
projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For the lower deck, he was aware of the decline of the air freight
and its share in commercial cargo area. He was already convinced by
the market interest and value for airline yield management, to the
point that when the results of the market study were presented, he
cut through the presentation to address technical and engineering
issues. He would be more interested in securing the concept on that
issue to gain autonomy from aircraft manufacturer and raise the
entry barrier as they knew competition (B/E Aerospace) had been
consulted for a similar project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the connected cabin, he challenged a lot the value proposition
as he was asking for proof of legitimacy for ZA to organize such
service market platform. In an interview in May 2018, a year after
the AIX 2017, he told the researcher he tried to encourage Zodiac
Data Systems BU manager to develop a technological advantage
securing the nascent market. It was another way of scouting for
different scenarios and testing the fixations of different BUs as
well as interdependent engineered product between BUs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite having same discussion goals to <em>define what makes rationality</em>
collectively with project representatives and potential stakeholders, it
appears that the steering committee could benefit from a technology of
organizing, by opposition to <em>fostering a culture of curiosity and sound
debate</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> to sustain innovation.</p>
<p>It appears then that several conditions can only be surfaced through
engineering design, project-based management and change management and
its active management around a model such as decisional ambidexterity.
Interactions and networking are not sufficient. Indeed, the former CEO
recognized the interest of having a practice to specify the model
testing, rationality testing practice on countless occasions. He was
very receptive to the decisional ambidexterity model and even felt it
was natural. The formalization is a real plus for a set of heuristics
that may not be acknowledged by everyone. Otherwise, he believes that it
is a widespread practice which counters procedural practices fixating
rationality. He also insisted on the danger of such mechanistic models
of thought (e.g. rational choice theory, operations research) which can
be the best way to go to the wall.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="chapter-synthesis-a-reconciliatory-model-for-ambidexterity">Chapter synthesis: a reconciliatory model for ambidexterity</h2>
<div class="alert alert-note">
  <div>
    <p>We show in this chapter how the researcher intervened in a project to
seed decisional ambidexterity. It reveals the significance to understand
the practice of design reasoning, modelling and formalization to discuss
the potential decisions and its categories. Coming back to the Multi-BU
committee we referred to in previous chapters, we also reveal how some
behaviours and practices relate to decisional ambidexterity and how it
could further benefit from it.</p>
<p>The researcher specified several different heuristics and supported the
team to effectively address the decision-design to address the
difficulty faced when dealing with a paradoxical request putting in
tension exploitation regime and exploration incentives. The work
conducted with them allowed to translate the engineering design work
with its mirroring for client relationship management, product
integration and internal engineering capabilities and organization
design. The methodological approach constantly addressed the mirroring
dynamics of the unknown in order to support generative learning and
capabilities regeneration.</p>
<p>The Multi-BU committee with the heuristics and culture fostered by the
ExCom can be considered from the perspective of decisional
ambidexterity. It wasn’t a decision meeting place, but rather networking
(Christiansen and Varnes <a href="#ref-Christiansen2007">2007</a>). However, this
networking benefited some systematic debate on the modelling,
hypothesis, problem formulation and value management. It allowed to
sustain a culture of curiosity and generative learning developing
vigilance for project management. But, we also point out that the
debates held in these meetings could also have benefited from a
technology of organization where decision-design could have been better
structured. For instance, we would have helped to systematically address
the interactions and the disentanglement of interdependencies in order
to overcome (organization) fixations effects rising from the
conglomerate of SMEs sustaining their respective niche markets.</p>
<p>Finally, in this chapter we have given further proof that the model of
decisional ambidexterity helps in managing the mutual conditioning
between exploration and exploitation, supporting decision-making in the
unknown for innovative design and interrelated change management.</p>
